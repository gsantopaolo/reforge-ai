# **operational guidelines** to up or refactoring a multi-module Java ecosystem:

---

## A. Module Classification

1. **Identify “Library” Modules**

   * Any module whose sole purpose is to house reusable domain logic, utilities, data models, etc., should be treated as a plain JAR.
   * Do **not** apply Spring Boot’s plugin or auto-run capability to these modules.
   * Ensure they declare `<packaging>jar</packaging>` in their POM.

2. **Identify “Spring Boot” Modules**

   * Modules that serve as entry points—either a web UI or standalone web service—become Spring Boot applications.
   * They must import the Spring Boot BOM, add the Spring Boot Maven plugin, and declare the relevant `spring-boot-starter` dependencies.

---

## B. Dependency Injection & Component Scanning

3. **Annotate Beans in Library Modules**

   * Within JAR modules, annotate services, components, and repositories with `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, etc.
   * Do **not** expect these beans to be bootstrapped until they’re included in a Spring Boot application.

4. **Configure the Spring Boot Entry Point**

   * In each `@SpringBootApplication` class, set `scanBasePackages` to include all the packages of your JAR modules so their annotated beans are discovered automatically.

---

## C. Build & Packaging

5. **Library Modules**

   * Omit the Spring Boot plugin and starters.
   * Rely on the parent POM’s `<dependencyManagement>` for version consistency.
   * Publish as JAR artifacts to your repository (Artifactory, Nexus, etc.).

6. **Spring Boot Modules**

   * Under `<dependencyManagement>`, import:

     ```xml
     <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-boot-dependencies</artifactId>
       <version>${boot.version}</version>
       <type>pom</type>
       <scope>import</scope>
     </dependency>
     ```
   * Under `<build><plugins>`, add:

     ```xml
     <plugin>
       <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
     </plugin>
     ```
   * Add only the `spring-boot-starter` modules you actually need (e.g. `spring-boot-starter-web` for REST/UI).

---

## D. Project Layout

7. **Parent POM Structure**

   ```
   parent-pom
   ├─ util-module         (jar)
   ├─ data-module         (jar)
   ├─ business-module     (jar)
   ├─ web-ui-module       (boot)
   └─ api-service-module  (boot)
   ```
8. **Inter-Module Dependencies**

   * Library modules depend only on each other as needed.
   * Spring Boot modules declare dependencies on the library modules they orchestrate.

---

## E. When to Promote a Library to a Service

9. **Independent Scaling or SLA**

   * If a library’s workload demands its own deployment, convert it into a Boot module.

10. **Dedicated Public API**

    * When you need to expose a domain’s functionality independently (e.g. a microservice), spin it off as a Spring Boot app.

11. **Distinct Ops Requirements**

    * Services needing separate configuration, metrics, health checks, or routing should be broken out into their own Boot modules.

---




## F. When to Promote a Library to a Service

1. **Keep most modules as plain JAR libraries**

   * Think of them as “DLLs” in .NET: they package reusable domain logic, utility code, data models, etc.
   * You don’t inject them with a container of their own—they just sit on the classpath of whatever runs them.
   * If they contain Spring-annotated beans (e.g. `@Component`, `@Service`), your Boot app will still pick them up as long as you include their packages in your component scan.

2. **Have exactly one (or a small handful) of Spring Boot applications**

   * **Web app**: the “UI” module, packaged as a fat-JAR (or WAR) with `spring-boot-starter-web`.
   * **Web service**: any back-end API you want to run separately (e.g. for microservices or background jobs).

### Why this works well

| Aspect                   | Plain-JAR Modules                                | Spring Boot Apps                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Packaging**            | `<packaging>jar</packaging>`                     | `<packaging>jar</packaging>` + plugin  |
| **Run lifecycle**        | N/A—used as libraries only                       | `java -jar`, `mvn spring-boot:run`     |
| **Dependency injection** | Beans declared but not bootstrapped on their own | Auto-configuration wires everything up |
| **Deployment**           | Bundled inside your Boot app                     | Deployed independently (if you choose) |
| **Team ownership**       | Shared code maintained centrally                 | Service teams own their app lifecycle  |

### How to structure it

1. **Multi-module Maven** (or Gradle) parent:

   ```text
   parent-pom
   ├─ util-module         (jar)  ← shared helper code
   ├─ data-module         (jar)  ← JPA entities & repositories
   ├─ business-module     (jar)  ← core domain services
   ├─ web-ui-module       (boot) ← Spring Boot + Thymeleaf/REST controllers
   └─ api-service-module  (boot) ← Spring Boot REST API (if needed)
   ```

2. **Library modules**:

   * No Spring Boot plugin in their POMs.
   * Just regular `<dependencyManagement>` from the parent for versions.
   * Package as `jar` and publish/install to your company Artifactory or local repo.
   * Annotate classes with Spring stereotypes (`@Component`, `@Service`, etc.) if you want them auto-discovered.

3. **Spring Boot modules**:

   * Import the Spring Boot BOM in `dependencyManagement`.
   * Add the Boot Maven plugin.
   * Depend on whichever library modules you need:

     ```xml
     <dependency>
       <groupId>com.example</groupId>
       <artifactId>business-module</artifactId>
     </dependency>
     ```
   * In your `@SpringBootApplication` on the Web UI, set `scanBasePackages` wide enough to include all the packages from your JAR modules.

---

### When to spin off a library into its own Boot service

* You need to **scale** or **deploy** that piece independently (e.g. heavy background processing, separate SLAs).
* You want to expose a **public API** just for that domain (vs. bundling it all behind the UI).
* You need distinct **configuration**, metrics, health checks, or routing for that service.

---





### Summary for the Agent

* **Treat** `*-util`, `*-data`, `*-core` modules as passive JAR libraries.
* **Only** configure and deploy modules that provide a user-facing UI or a standalone service as Spring Boot applications.
* **Ensure** component scanning bridges your JARs into each Boot app at startup.
* **Promote** a library to a Boot service only when operational isolation or independent APIs are required.
