Great. I’ll research real-world examples and frameworks where large legacy systems (especially in Java) were analyzed or migrated using human teams and AI agents. I’ll focus on use cases involving codebase modernization, repository analysis, and LLM/agentic tools like CrewAI. I’ll also review the provided Medium articles and CrewAI documentation to guide the definition of agents, tools, and task workflows for your solo developer/AI-agent use case.

I’ll get back to you with a detailed mapping of:

* AI-powered agents and their roles
* Tools (LLM-driven and conventional)
* Workflow phases with agent involvement and goals
* Manager/reviewer oversight for each task

Thanks for the references—I'll include insights from those in the final design.


# Modernizing a Legacy Java Codebase with Human & AI Agent Collaboration

## Introduction

Modernizing a large legacy codebase (e.g. upgrading from Java 8 to Java 17 or 21) is a complex but critical endeavor. Legacy systems often carry significant **technical debt** – outdated frameworks, deprecated APIs, and lack of documentation – which impede agility and pose security risks. Traditionally, organizations upgrade incrementally (Java 8 → 11 → 17) to manage risk, as seen in Systematic’s defense software: a massive Java 8 monolith with plugins was gradually migrated to Java 17 (via Java 11) to leverage modern language features, improve maintainability, and patch vulnerabilities. Such efforts demand careful dependency updates, API replacements, and rigorous testing. In short, **modernization** is not just a version bump – it’s *“untangling chaos”* from years of postponed upgrades, requiring planning, domain knowledge, and often months of engineering work.

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** promise to accelerate this process, but real-world results reveal limitations. General-purpose LLMs (like vanilla GPT-4) perform well on small coding tasks but *“consistently break down in real-world, repository-level translations”*, often achieving <10% success when faced with complex interdependent code. Blindly relying on an LLM to rewrite millions of lines can yield unreliable code. The key insight from recent studies is that **hybrid approaches** vastly outperform naive LLM-only attempts. For example, specialized translation pipelines that combine AI with compiler-like static transformations have achieved *over 90% automation*, whereas a generic LLM alone might barely reach 10%. In practice, this means pairing LLMs with traditional tools and human oversight. As one engineer put it, *“the solution isn’t to abandon either traditional approaches or AI, but to create a controlled synergy between them”*, keeping *“AI under control”* to deliver incremental modernization wins.

Another guiding principle is *“habitable code”*: focus modernization efforts on the critical, high-traffic parts of the system first. Rather than trying to perfect every module, prioritize the areas that deliver the most business value or suffer the most pain (like core services – the “kitchen and bathroom” of your codebase). This ensures that limited resources (human or AI) target the **highest-impact improvements**. Modernization is ultimately an iterative, economic decision – the goal is to *“evolve the code fast enough to meet market demands”* without boiling the ocean.

## Traditional vs. AI-Assisted Modernization Approaches

**Traditional Human-Driven Modernization:** In a conventional scenario, a **human team** undertakes a sequence of steps:

* **Assessment & Planning:** Senior developers study the legacy code, identify breaking changes (e.g. Java 17 removed APIs, updated syntax, library incompatibilities), and draft a migration plan. They might use static analyzers and checklists to find usage of deprecated APIs or outdated libraries.
* **Incremental Upgrades:** The team modernizes the code in stages – for example, first updating build scripts and dependencies, then addressing source code issues. Systematic’s migration to Java 17, for instance, involved updating many third-party libraries and fixing removed Java APIs before leveraging new features.
* **Testing & Validation:** A comprehensive test suite is essential. Teams run unit/integration tests to catch behavior changes. New tests may be written to cover previously untested areas, ensuring the modernized code remains correct and performant.
* **Documentation & Knowledge Transfer:** Throughout the process, developers document changes and update any design docs or READMEs to reflect the new system state, since up-to-date documentation helps maintain *“habitable”* and maintainable code going forward.

This process is effective but **labor-intensive and slow**. Estimates for a large codebase (millions of lines) can run into many developer-months. For example, Cloudlytics initially estimated a 6-month effort to upgrade \~4 million lines across 40+ modules from Java 8 to 17. Challenges such as interwoven dependencies, strict uptime requirements, and a lack of prior documentation can bog down progress. It’s not uncommon for such projects to slip as teams juggle migration with ongoing feature development.

**AI/LLM-Assisted Modernization:** Augmenting the human workflow with AI can drastically accelerate these steps, as recent case studies show. Cloudlytics turned their 6-month Java 8→17 migration into a **6-week sprint** by leveraging an AI tool called *Amazon Q*. Amazon Q is a generative AI service designed for code transformation:

* It **automatically analyzed** the entire Java 8 codebase, flagging incompatible patterns and suggesting Java 17 replacements.
* It performed *“automated refactoring”* on the code, outputting diffs for developers to review.
* It also ran and *validated tests*, ensuring the upgraded code’s performance and stability.
  This automation meant the project only needed *2 developers and 1 QA* to oversee it (versus a much larger team). Ultimately, Cloudlytics achieved a 4× faster migration, with improved performance and security as Java 17 features and patches took effect.

Another emerging toolset is **Konveyor** (CNCF project), which provides migration utilities. Its *Konveyor AI (Kai)* prototype blends static code analysis with LLMs to suggest code updates. Kai uses an LSP-based analyzer to identify required changes (e.g. `javax` → `jakarta` namespace, EJB to REST conversion) via rules, then invokes LLMs to generate the new code. It even employs an *agent that iteratively refines code suggestions* by checking compilation/tests and feeding errors back to the LLM for correction – a loop of *self-debugging* similar to techniques in research (e.g. using unit tests and execution to improve code generation). This greatly helps with repetitive changes: if a logging API needs replacement across dozens of files, the AI can propagate that change consistently. While Kai is still experimental, it exemplifies AI-driven refactoring where the heavy lifting is automated and humans focus on reviewing and guiding the AI.

**The Role of Humans with AI:** Crucially, even with advanced AI, human engineers remain in the loop as **directors and reviewers**. Studies on LLM-based code migration emphasize that developers want to *steer* AI and not just rubber-stamp its output. In practice, this means a human or a specialized agent defines the high-level goals (which modules to modernize first, acceptable styles, etc.) and reviews AI-made changes with the same rigor as they would peer code. AI suggestions must meet the team’s quality standards for readability, performance, and domain correctness. If the AI’s code isn’t up to par, it gets rejected or refined – just as if a junior developer’s code review would be sent back for fixes. This collaborative workflow (AI doing grunt work, humans providing oversight) aligns with evidence that **humans still outperform AI in complex software tasks by roughly 2×**, especially in understanding business context. Therefore, the optimal setup is **AI-augmented developers**, not autonomous AI in isolation. The AI handles rote translations and broad analyses; the humans tackle edge cases, make final judgments, and inject domain knowledge that the AI lacks.

## Multi-Agent Frameworks for Modernization (CrewAI & Others)

To effectively combine human insight with AI speed, a promising approach is to orchestrate **multiple specialized AI agents** as a *“crew”*. Instead of one monolithic LLM trying to do everything, we assign different roles to different agents (some AI, some human), each focusing on a facet of the modernization. Frameworks like **CrewAI**, AutoGen, LangChain’s agents, and MetaGPT have emerged to facilitate this kind of orchestration. With CrewAI, for example, you can define a team of LLM-driven agents where *“each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals”*. One agent might be a “Code Reader” specialized in scanning repositories, another a “Refactorer” adept at writing new code, another a “Tester” agent running validations. They operate under a **Crew orchestrator** that manages their collaboration and task sequencing. This design parallels a real development team: specialists cooperate, and a manager coordinates to ensure the overall goal is met.

Key benefits of a multi-agent setup include:

* **Role Specialization:** Each agent can be tailored (via prompt or fine-tuning) to excel at a specific task (e.g. parsing build files, or explaining code). This beats a general LLM handling everything poorly. For instance, a “Documentation Agent” can use a documentation style guide prompt, while a “Static Analyzer Agent” uses a different reasoning approach.
* **Tool Integration:** Agents can be equipped with tools and APIs beyond just the LLM. CrewAI allows binding agents to external tools like code search, compilers, linters, etc.. For example, an agent tasked with dependency updates might invoke a Maven command or an OpenRewrite script. Another agent might call a vector database to perform semantic code search when trying to understand cross-cutting concerns. This mix of symbolic tools with AI provides both precision and flexibility.
* **Concurrent Workflows:** Some tasks can run in parallel. Multiple agent “workers” can each document different modules simultaneously, speeding up the documentation phase. The orchestrator ensures no overlap or conflict. This mimics how a human team might divide and conquer a large codebase for analysis.
* **Autonomy with Oversight:** Agents make autonomous decisions on routine matters (e.g. trivial code fixes), but the framework can require approval from a **Manager agent** (or a human) for critical changes. CrewAI supports hierarchical structures where a *manager agent supervises others*, analogous to a tech lead reviewing a junior’s work. If an agent is unsure or encounters an error, it can even defer to a human-in-the-loop or request guidance (some frameworks allow pausing for human input).

In summary, multi-agent systems provide an “AI team” that mirrors best practices of human teams. As one report notes, they *“enable multiple LLMs to play distinct roles and break down complex tasks into phases”*, which is ideal for something as multifaceted as repository-wide modernization. We will leverage this approach to outline an actionable design for documenting and modernizing the legacy Java codebase.

## Proposed Agent Team and Required Tools

To modernize and document the codebase, we define a **team of autonomous/semi-autonomous agents**, each with clear responsibilities. The table below summarizes the agents, their roles, the tools they use, and whether they rely on LLMs:

| **Agent Role**                     | **Responsibilities**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Key Tools/Techniques**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **LLM Usage**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Project Manager Agent** (PM)     | *Orchestrator & planner.* Sets overall modernization goals, prioritizes tasks (e.g. which modules to tackle first), and coordinates agent activities. Ensures the “habitable code” principle – focusing on high-impact areas. Monitors progress and adjusts plans based on feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | - Crew orchestration logic (task scheduling)<br>- Maintains a high-level **project plan** (could be a JSON of tasks/stages).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | *Minimal.* (Primarily logic-based; may use an LLM occasionally to summarize status or refine plans, but not heavily.)                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Codebase Analyst Agent**         | *Inventory & static analysis.* Scans the entire repository to map out modules, packages, and their interdependencies. Identifies hotspots: files with most frequent changes or critical business functions (to align with habitable-code focus). Also detects usages of deprecated APIs or Java 8 idioms that need modernization. Outputs a **Codebase Report** (architecture overview, dependency graph, list of problematic code patterns).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | - Static analysis tools (e.g. Konveyor **LSP analyzer** for Java code, SonarQube or PMD for code smells)<br>- **Dependency analyzers** (e.g. Maven/Gradle dependency tree to list external libs).<br>- Possibly uses **OpenRewrite** scanning recipes to find Java8→17 migration points (without applying them yet).                                                                                                                                                                                               | *Low.* (Uses rule-based tools; may use an LLM to interpret complex analysis results or to query “Find all occurrences of pattern X” via a code search LLM, but primarily non-LLM processing.)                                                                                                         |
| **Documentation Agent**            | *Code understanding & documentation.* Iterates through the codebase to produce human-readable documentation. Generates **Javadoc-style comments** for public classes/methods that lack them, writes high-level **module overviews** describing each component’s purpose, and compiles an **architecture document** explaining how pieces fit together. It can also create user-friendly summaries of legacy business logic (e.g. describe what a critical algorithm does in plain English).                                                                                                                                                                            | - **Code parser**: reads source files AST to extract signatures, call graphs.<br>- **LLM summarizer**: uses a code-specialized LLM (e.g. GPT-4, StarCoder) to generate descriptions of code behavior. This might involve feeding the agent the code (or using retrieval to provide relevant context) and prompting “Explain the following code…”.<br>- **Knowledge base**: stores generated docs in a wiki or markdown files.                                                                                      | *High.* (Heavily uses LLM for natural language generation. Ideally uses an LLM fine-tuned on code documentation to improve accuracy and avoid hallucinations.)                                                                                                                                        |
| **Refactoring Agent**              | *Automated code modernization.* Proposes and possibly applies code changes to update the legacy code to modern Java standards. For example, it can suggest replacing `Thread.sleep` with `java.time` APIs, converting old for-loops to streams, or migrating `javax.security` imports to the new Jakarta equivalents. It executes known **transform recipes** for straightforward fixes (using something like OpenRewrite’s 2000+ migration recipes), and uses the LLM for more context-sensitive refactorings. Produces a **Change List** (diffs) for each suggested code modification, without merging them automatically.                                           | - **OpenRewrite or similar** to perform AST transformations for known patterns (ensures consistency and correctness for trivial refactors).<br>- **LLM code transformer**: an LLM to handle complex refactorings or API swaps not covered by rules. (e.g. use GPT-4 to rewrite a method using a new library, given the old code as input).<br>- **Compiler/test runner**: compiles and runs tests on the refactored code in a sandbox to verify nothing breaks (this agent can invoke the Testing Agent for help). | *High.* (Uses LLM for generating code changes in natural language-heavy transformations. Benefits from a *few-shot prompt* with examples of old→new code to guide it. After initial LLM output, uses non-LLM tools to verify the change compiles and passes tests.)                                   |
| **Testing Agent**                  | *Validation & quality assurance.* Runs automated tests and static checks on the codebase as changes are proposed. If documentation is produced, it checks that the documented behavior matches the code (potentially by generating simple assertions or analyzing method contracts). For code changes, it executes the existing test suite (unit/integration tests) and reports failures. It can also generate additional **unit tests** for critical functions using an LLM (to increase coverage in fragile areas). Essentially, this agent ensures that modernization efforts do not introduce regressions.                                                         | - **Build system**: to compile and run tests (Maven, Gradle, JUnit, etc.).<br>- **LLM test generator**: e.g. use Codex/GPT-4 to write tests for a given function if coverage is low.<br>- **Static analyzers**: like SpotBugs or QA rules to catch potential issues (e.g. thread-safety, serialization) after refactoring.<br>- **Runtime sandbox**: possibly run the application (or critical flows) in a contained env to smoke test basic functionality.                                                        | *Moderate.* (Uses LLM for test generation or interpreting results, but test execution itself is non-LLM. Also might use an LLM to summarize test failure logs and pinpoint which change caused it.)                                                                                                   |
| **Domain Expert Agent** (optional) | *Business context integration.* If domain knowledge (e.g. finance calculations, healthcare rules) is crucial to understanding the code, this (possibly human-guided) agent ensures documentation and refactoring keep the *business intent* intact. It reviews documentation for correctness against known requirements and can inject clarifications. For example, it might cross-check that an algorithm described in docs matches the spec in external manuals.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | - **Existing documentation**: ingest any available design docs, requirements, or user manuals and use them as reference (via a retrieval tool).<br>- **LLM Q\&A**: allow it to query an LLM with domain knowledge (if a knowledge base exists) to clarify why certain legacy code was written a certain way.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | *Low/Moderate.* (Primarily a consumer of info; might use LLM for Q\&A on domain specifics. Often this role could be filled by a human stakeholder providing input to the agents.)                                                                                                                     |
| **Reviewer Agent**                 | *Quality control & oversight.* Acts as a “second set of eyes” for outputs from other agents. This agent does not produce new content; it **critiques and verifies** others’ work. For documentation, it reviews summaries against the actual code to catch inaccuracies or overly vague descriptions (using code analysis or even re-generating a summary and diffing it). For code changes, it performs code review: checking style, correctness, and consistency with project norms. It might run a diff through an LLM asking “Does this change preserve functionality?” to catch subtle mistakes. The Reviewer can approve, request refinement, or reject outputs. | - **Diff analysis tools**: to ensure changes are behavior-preserving (could use semantic diff tools or symbol table comparisons).<br>- **LLM critic**: use a separate LLM prompt to evaluate documentation accuracy or code diff correctness (somewhat like ChatGPT plugins that review code).<br>- **Policy rules**: project-specific guidelines (e.g. don’t use experimental APIs) to validate against.                                                                                                          | *High.* (Uses LLMs to double-check and critique content, which is a natural language intensive task. By using a different LLM instance or model as a “critic”, we reduce bias from the original generation. For crucial portions, this agent may escalate to the human developer for final sign-off.) |

**Tools Summary:** In our setup, many tools assist the agents. Some are traditional static analysis or build tools (which do *not* require LLM intelligence), and others are AI-driven. Below is a list of key tools and whether they involve LLMs:

* **Static Code Analyzer:** e.g. Konveyor’s analysis engine or SonarQube. Scans code for known issues (deprecated API usage, etc.) and produces a report. *No LLM* – purely rule-based .
* **Dependency Mapper:** Uses Maven/Gradle to list all dependencies and versions, checking against a database of compatibility (to see which need upgrades). *No LLM* (scripted automation).
* **OpenRewrite Recipes:** A library of automated refactoring rules (over 2,000 recipes for Java migrations) to apply mechanical changes (like updating syntax). *No LLM* – uses compiler AST transformations.
* **Vector Search & Retrieval:** Creates embeddings of code or documentation to enable semantic search (e.g. find related functions by meaning, not just text). Could use an embedding model (like CodeBERT or OpenAI Embeddings). *Uses an ML model*, but not a large language model per se; however, it aids LLM agents in retrieving relevant context.
* **LLM Code Summarizer/Generator:** (Core **LLM** component) – e.g. GPT-4, Codex, or a code-tuned model, used by Documentation and Refactoring agents to generate text (documentation or code). *Uses LLM*. We will prefer specialized code models when possible for better accuracy.
* **Code Interpreter environment:** Allows agents to execute code or queries (similar to ChatGPT’s code interpreter). This is used by Testing and Reviewer agents to run code, evaluate expressions, or try out a refactor in a sandbox. *Not an LLM itself*, but often paired with one (the agent decides to run code as part of its reasoning).
* **Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline:** Although external to agents, hooking the agents into a CI system (for running full test suites, etc.) is useful. *No LLM.*
* **Knowledge Base/Wiki:** A central place (could be Confluence or markdown in a repo) where the Documentation agent writes output. Agents can read/write here. *No LLM* to store, but LLM may read from it to avoid redundancy.

Each agent uses an appropriate subset of these tools. Notably, the **LLM-centric tools** are used where creativity or language understanding is needed (documentation, complex code generation, semantic checks), whereas **deterministic tools** handle structured tasks (parsing code, applying known refactors, running tests). This aligns with expert recommendations to *“blend LLM capabilities with traditional compiler logic and custom tooling”* for reliable automation.

## Task Breakdown for Documenting and Modernizing the Codebase

Using the above agents, we break the project into a sequence of **tasks**. Each task has a clear goal and deliverable, a primary **Responsible Agent**, and designated agents for **management** and **review** to ensure quality. This approach mirrors a robust human workflow with planning and code review stages, but accelerated by AI assistance.

Below is the breakdown of major tasks:

1. **Initialize Project Knowledge Base** – *Goal:* Set up a central repository of information (e.g. an internal wiki or markdown docs in Git) to accumulate documentation and analysis results. The **PM Agent** is responsible for this initialization (creating the structure: sections for architecture, modules, dependencies, etc.). It may use the Developer’s input about any known high-level architecture. **Manager:** Project Manager Agent (ensures all sections needed are accounted for). **Reviewer:** (Human developer) – *This is a preparatory step*, so mainly the human oversees that the scope covers everything important.

2. **Codebase Inventory & Architecture Mapping** – *Goal:* Get a bird’s-eye view of the system. The **Codebase Analyst Agent** scans the code and produces an **Architecture Report**. This includes a list of modules/packages, their relationships (e.g. “Module A depends on Module B and an external lib C”), and identifies critical components (by size or commit frequency). It also lists all external dependencies with versions. **Manager:** Project Manager Agent (guides the Analyst to focus on “high-traffic” areas first, e.g. core business modules). **Reviewer:** Reviewer Agent – it cross-checks a sample of the report for accuracy (e.g. verify that a listed dependency actually appears in the build file, or that no major subsystem was missed). If the Analyst agent missed something (maybe an unmapped circular dependency), the Reviewer flags it for a re-run or human attention.

3. **Legacy Code Static Analysis** – *Goal:* Identify all hotspots for modernization. Here the **Codebase Analyst Agent** (or a sub-agent) runs static analysis rules specifically targeting Java 8 → 17 changes. It generates a **Modernization Incidents List** – e.g. “X number of uses of `PermGen` API (removed in Java 11)”, “Y occurrences of old date/time API that could use `java.time`”, “Z library uses that require update (e.g. old Spring version)”. This task uses static code analyzers and OpenRewrite recipes. **Manager:** Project Manager Agent (ensures all relevant rule sets are applied – for Java version, for frameworks, etc.). **Reviewer:** Reviewer Agent – verifies a few sample findings by manually inspecting code (or via an LLM prompting: “is there indeed an issue at this line?”). The reviewer ensures false positives are minimal. The output is essentially a **to-do list** of code refactoring targets.

4. **Documentation Generation (per Module)** – *Goal:* Create detailed documentation for each significant module or component. The **Documentation Agent** works module-by-module (or service-by-service), performing two sub-tasks repeatedly:

   * **In-line Documentation:** Generate missing Javadoc comments and improve code comments for clarity. The agent might commit comment changes in the code repository (or prepare a patch) for later approval.
   * **Module Guide:** Write a summary explaining the module’s purpose, key classes, and how it interacts with others (using info from the Architecture Report). This goes into the knowledge base (e.g. a page per module).

   This process heavily uses the LLM to read code and produce explanations. **Manager:** *Domain Expert Agent* or Project Manager – provides any domain context (“this module handles payment processing”) to guide accurate docs. **Reviewer:** Reviewer Agent – checks each documentation artifact. For code comments, it might run the code to ensure the comment’s claim matches behavior (or use an LLM to compare code and comment). For module guides, it ensures terminology is correct and nothing important is misrepresented. The reviewer may consult the human developer for clarifications if the code’s intent was misinterpreted by the LLM. This task yields a comprehensive **Code Documentation** set.

5. **Modernization Planning** – *Goal:* Formulate a concrete plan to implement the code updates needed (identified in Task 3) while minimizing risk. The **Project Manager Agent** (with input from the human developer) uses the Incident List and newly created documentation to write a **Modernization Roadmap**. This plan prioritizes changes (e.g. update logging library across all modules first, then tackle replacing legacy date APIs, etc.), grouping them into phases. It also references the test coverage – if a high-risk area lacks tests, the plan might schedule writing tests (possibly using the Testing Agent to generate some) before making changes. **Manager:** Project Manager Agent (since this is its responsibility anyway). **Reviewer:** *Human Developer* – this is a strategic plan, so the human should review it carefully, adjusting the priorities based on business deadlines or team knowledge. The output is a clear step-by-step plan that both human and AI agents will follow to actually refactor the code.

6. **Automated Refactoring & Code Changes** – *Goal:* Execute the modernization in code, step by step as per the plan. For each planned change (e.g. “replace all uses of Library X with Library Y version Z” or “migrate module A to use new API”), the **Refactoring Agent** performs the code modifications. This might be done change-type by change-type or module by module. For reliability, we do this in small batches:

   * The Refactoring Agent applies OpenRewrite recipes for well-known changes (for example, there may be a ready recipe to migrate Java 8 date/time to `java.time`).
   * For changes without a predefined recipe, the agent uses the LLM to generate code modifications. It works locally on a copy of the repo and produces a patch/diff.
     After each batch, the **Testing Agent** runs the test suite to catch regressions. Any failures or anomalies are fed back: The Refactoring Agent (or an AI sub-agent) will analyze failing tests and adjust the code, or mark that change for human review if the fix isn’t obvious. This approach is inspired by tools like Amazon Q, which *“highlight code changes and even suggest adding dependencies”* needed to make the code compile, and by research where LLMs augmented with unit tests iteratively correct code.

   Each change batch is **Managed** by the Project Manager Agent (ensuring the sequence respects dependencies – e.g. don’t upgrade to Java 17 syntax until incompatible libraries are removed). **Reviewer:** Reviewer Agent (and human for final say) – the Reviewer Agent examines the diffs. It uses an LLM to ensure the diff looks logically sound and checks that the Refactoring Agent didn’t introduce new warnings or TODOs. Once the reviewer agent is satisfied, the human developer can do a quick final review and merge the changes. This task may repeat for multiple phases until all target modernizations are applied. The end result is an **Updated Codebase** on the latest Java version and frameworks, with all tests passing.

7. **Augment Documentation for Changes** – *Goal:* Update the documentation to reflect the new codebase post-refactoring. The **Documentation Agent** revisits the docs it wrote in Task 4 and revises any parts that changed due to refactoring. For example, if a module’s internal algorithm was rewritten or a class was replaced, its documentation must be updated. This is a smaller task – essentially a diff between old and new code documentation, which the agent can generate automatically. **Manager:** Project Manager Agent (making sure no doc is overlooked). **Reviewer:** Reviewer Agent (verifies that docs and code remain in sync). The deliverable is a fully **modernized codebase with up-to-date documentation**.

8. **Final Review & Knowledge Handover** – *Goal:* Solidify trust in the modernized system and hand off knowledge. The human developer (acting as a final Reviewer/Mentor) goes through the documentation and code changes with the help of the agents to answer any remaining questions. For instance, the Domain Expert Agent might facilitate a review session: the human asks “Why did we remove Library X?” and the agent pulls up the rationale from the knowledge base or incident list. Any lingering inconsistencies are corrected now. The team (human + AI) produces a short **Modernization Summary Report** for stakeholders, highlighting the improvements (e.g. “Removed 5 insecure APIs, upgraded 12 libraries, performance improved by X, etc.”). This stage ensures that the **senior developer (user)** fully understands the outcome and can confidently maintain the new system going forward. **Manager:** Human Developer (at this point, the human is in full control, using agents only as assistants). **Reviewer:** Possibly another human or lead (if available) or just the human themselves double-checking everything with agent support.

Throughout these tasks, the **manager and reviewer roles** are crucial for quality control:

* The **Project Manager Agent** (and by extension the human project owner) acts as a constant guide, deciding what each agent should do and when. This ensures the process doesn’t drift from business goals. If the PM Agent is AI-driven, it follows predefined rules and can ask the human for guidance when needed (for example, CrewAI allows conditional tasks and human approval steps).
* The **Reviewer Agent** provides an automated check at each step, catching errors early. Think of it as an AI pair-programmer reviewing every commit. For instance, if the Documentation Agent mistakenly describes a function’s behavior, the Reviewer Agent flags the discrepancy by comparing it to the code logic (possibly using its own LLM analysis). This mirrors the best practice of code reviews in human teams, which is now done at AI speed for every change. By the time the human sees outputs, most obvious issues are already filtered out.

Finally, it’s worth noting that **human oversight** is the ultimate safety net. At any point, if an agent’s output is uncertain or low-confidence, the system should involve the human. Modern frameworks allow for this kind of interruption: for example, a CrewAI agent can be configured to request human input upon ambiguous decisions. The Amazon study on AI code migration found that *“developers desire involvement not only during code review, but also in directing the AI to produce the desired output”*. Our design reflects that: the human (you, the senior dev) remains the **executive decision-maker**, with AI agents as powerful assistants. This human-AI partnership can significantly accelerate legacy code modernization while preserving high quality and reliability – essentially *“combining human expertise with automation tools to tackle large-scale modernization projects efficiently”*.

## Conclusion

By leveraging a coordinated team of specialized AI agents (for analysis, documentation, refactoring, testing, etc.) under the guidance of a human engineer, large-scale codebase modernization becomes an achievable, **streamlined process**. We integrate **traditional static analysis** and proven refactoring tools with **LLM-driven intelligence** where it adds value, all within a structured workflow that emphasizes oversight and quality control. Real-world cases already demonstrate the efficacy of this approach – from Amazon’s AI-powered code transformations (upgrading 1000+ apps in days) to enterprise stories of slashing migration timelines from months to weeks. The design outlined above provides an actionable blueprint: a solo senior developer can effectively “staff” their own AI-assisted team and execute a legacy Java modernization with confidence. The key is to let each agent (including the human) do what it does best: use LLMs to accelerate grunt work (documentation, boilerplate code changes) while **keeping humans in control for direction and final review**. With this balanced strategy, organizations can rapidly modernize their critical software – embracing new technology generations without jeopardizing the stability and knowledge built into their legacy systems.

**Sources:** The approach and examples are informed by recent industry case studies, research, and frameworks, including multi-agent systems like CrewAI, studies on human-AI collaboration in code migration, and specific experiences migrating Java monoliths to modern platforms. Each referenced insight has been integrated to ensure the system design is grounded in proven practices and state-of-the-art techniques.
