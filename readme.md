ReforgeAI is an agentic AI system that automatically analyzes existing code, 
generates a transformation plan, and completes the transformation tasks suggested by the plan. 
It identifies and updates package dependencies and refactors deprecated and inefficient code components, 
switching to new language frameworks and incorporating security best practices. 
Once complete, the transformed code can be reviewed, complete with build and test results, 
before accepting the changes.
