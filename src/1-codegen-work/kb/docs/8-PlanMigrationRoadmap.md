Migration Roadmap for kitchensink Java Project Migration to Java 21 and Spring Boot

---

Phase 1: Util Package Migration - Establish Foundation

- Scope: Extract and migrate the `util` package (e.g. `Resources.java`) as a standalone Spring Modulith module.
- Objectives:
  - Replace legacy logging with SLF4J + Logback.
  - Migrate to Java 21 language features incrementally.
  - Setup Spring Modulith module boundaries for later modularization.
- Timeline: Sprint 1 - 2 (2 weeks)
- Dependencies: None (lowest coupling package)
- Risk Mitigation:
  - Validate logging configuration consistency.
  - Run comprehensive tests to ensure utility behavior is preserved.
- Human Review Checkpoint: Code review after package extraction and modularization.

---

Phase 2: Data and Service Layers Migration - Core Business Logic

- Scope: Migrate `data` and `service` packages:
  - Transition from JPA `EntityManager` to Spring Data JPA repositories (`MemberRepository` refactoring).
  - Convert EJBs to Spring `@Service` classes with `@Transactional` management.
  - Adapt dependency injection from CDI (`@Inject`) to Spring `@Autowired`.
- Timeline: Sprint 3 - 5 (3 weeks)
- Dependencies: Completion of Phase 1
- Risk Mitigation:
  - Risk R1: Data access changes—mitigate by automated tests and query validation.
  - Risk R4: Transactional boundaries—implement Spring transaction management carefully.
  - Use OpenRewrite scripts for namespace and annotation refactoring.
- Human Review Checkpoint: Peer review of repository and service refactorings with integration testing.

---

Phase 3: Controller and REST API Migration - Interface Layer Modernization

- Scope: Refactor `controller` and `rest` packages:
  - Replace JAX-RS annotations with Spring MVC REST annotations.
  - Remove JAX-RS activator; use Spring Boot auto-configuration.
  - Implement REST API endpoints via `@RestController`.
- Timeline: Sprint 6 - 7 (2 weeks)
- Dependencies: Completion of Phase 2
- Risk Mitigation:
  - Risks R2 and R3: API activation and routing—Mitigate by endpoint tests and proper Spring Boot setup.
  - Implement URL routing tests and backward compatibility with API Gateway for coexistence.
- Human Review Checkpoint: Validation of REST endpoints and contract testing with UI or clients.

---

Phase 4: Testing Framework Upgrade - Validation and Automation

- Scope: Upgrade tests from JUnit 4 and Arquillian to JUnit 5 (Jupiter) and `@SpringBootTest`.
- Timeline: Sprint 8 (1 week)
- Dependencies: Completion of Phase 3
- Risk Mitigation:
  - Risk R6: Testing framework incompatibilities mitigated by parallel execution and conversion scripts.
  - Expand integration test coverage for Spring context.
- Human Review Checkpoint: Review migrated tests and CI pipeline adaptation.

---

Phase 5: Performance Optimization and Virtual Threads Adoption

- Scope: Introduce Java 21 virtual threads in high-throughput components (service and rest layers).
- Objectives:
  - Incrementally refactor high I/O or concurrency operations.
  - Leverage Project Loom capabilities.
- Timeline: Sprint 9 (1 week)
- Dependencies: Completion of Phase 4
- Risk Mitigation:
  - Introduce extensive performance and stability testing.
  - Monitor resource utilization, fallback planning on regressions.
- Human Review Checkpoint: Performance test results review and operational readiness validation.

---

Phase 6: Legacy System Decommission and Final Modularization

- Scope: Complete legacy system retirement.
  - Consolidate all codebases to Spring Boot Java 21.
  - Optimize modularity for microservice extraction or monolith simplification.
- Timeline: Sprint 10 - 12 (3 weeks)
- Dependencies: Successful completion of previous phases
- Risk Mitigation:
  - Final risk mitigation on overall system stability, data consistency.
  - Verification of migration completeness including documentation.
- Human Review Checkpoint: Full system audit, stakeholder sign-off, final documentation update.

---

Cross-Phase Notes:

- Utilize Strangler Fig and Branch-by-Abstraction patterns to gradually migrate modules while allowing coexistence.
- Use OpenRewrite for automatic code modernization tasks.
- CI pipelines include periodic code quality and migration compliance gates.
- Continuous integration of Flyway/Liquibase for database schema versioning.
- Risk Register maintained and updated for early detection and mitigation.
- Schedule weekly sync meetings and documentation updates for transparency.

Summary Table of Risks and Mitigations:

| Risk ID | Description                               | Mitigation                     | Phase  |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------|
| R1      | Data access changes (EntityManager to Spring Data)   | Automated testing and query validation | 2      |
| R2      | REST endpoint registration (JAX-RS to Spring MVC)    | Endpoint testing and Spring Boot config validation | 3      |
| R3      | API routing and compatibility issues                 | API Gateway use and contract testing | 3      |
| R4      | Transaction management changes EJB to Spring          | Use @Transactional and retest transaction boundaries | 2      |
| R5      | CDI to Spring DI migration issues                      | Replace annotations, verify component scanning | 2      |
| R6      | Testing framework migration (JUnit4/Arquillian to JUnit5/SpringBootTest) | Parallel execution and phased test migration | 4      |
| R7      | Validation framework compatibility                     | Configure Spring validation starter correctly | 2-3    |
| R8      | Namespace migration (javax.* to jakarta.*)             | Use OpenRewrite automation       | 2-3    |
