The user wants a clear, focused plan for migrating Kitchensink, with full attention on the process. No blending with other goals—only Spring Boot 3.2 and Java 21. The user's previous plans included general, non-specific strategies, but they now want to dedicate 150% of the focus to this task. I’m going to ensure the guidance is tailored exactly to their wish, no distractions, so I'll refine the plan accordingly. I just need to check which sources will be most relevant to supporting this clear migration strategy.

---

I need to conduct multiple search queries to gather resources on migrating JBoss to Spring Boot 3.2 and related technologies. I'll search for things like "migrate Jboss EE to Spring Boot 3.2" and topics around migrating JSF and JAX-RS. I also want more specific terms, including Java 21 virtual threads for Spring Boot, and a few patterns like the Strangler Fig for Java EE migration. Then, I'll gather relevant and diverse sources and use them to guide the migration plan for Kitchensink, ensuring I focus on the right context.

I need to gather sources for migrating Kitchensink to Spring Boot 3.2, focused on JBoss migration, JAX-RS, JSF, and other related topics like Java 21 virtual threads, domain-driven design, and specific patterns like Strangler Fig. I’ve already set up multiple search queries to pull in the right information. Now, I'll sift through the results, pick relevant resources, and make sure the response is centered solely on helping with the Kitchensink migration. The priority is staying focused on this task!

The user has asked for a detailed migration plan focusing solely on Kitchensink from JBoss to Spring Boot 3.2. I’ll break it into clear phases for the migration: environment setup, module extraction, data and service migration, web layer updates, integrating virtual threads, and preparing for microservices. Each section will be backed by at least 10 citations. The plan needs to be comprehensive and methodical, using reliable sources for each part of the process to ensure accuracy. I'll also make sure the citations are added after each sentence.


Thought for 21 seconds


Below is a **focused, step-by-step migration plan** for the JBoss **Kitchensink** quickstart (JSF, CDI, EJB, JPA, JAX-RS) to **Spring Boot 3.2 + Java 21**. Each phase includes precise tasks, recommended tools, and LLM-agent actions.

## Summary

We’ll migrate Kitchensink in five tightly scoped phases:

1. **Environment & Build Upgrade** – prepare Java 21, convert build to Maven/Gradle, apply OpenRewrite recipes.
2. **Module Extraction (Util)** – carve out the `util` package into a Spring Modulith module.
3. **Data & Service Layers** – migrate JPA → Spring Data JPA, EJB/CDI → Spring @Services.
4. **Web Layer & UI** – convert JAX-RS → Spring MVC/REST and JSF → Thymeleaf or JSF-on-Spring integration.
5. **Performance & Final Cut-Over** – enable virtual threads, implement Strangler Fig façade, deprecate legacy WAR.

---

## Environment Preparation

1. **Upgrade to Java 21** and set `sourceCompatibility = '21'` in your build. The Kitchensink sample uses JBoss EE 7 Quickstarts; upgrading the JDK is the prerequisite ([prezi.com][1]).
2. **Convert to Maven (or Gradle)**. Generate a new Spring Boot 3.2 starter project and copy `pom.xml` settings. Use the **OpenRewrite `UpgradeSpringBoot_3_2`** recipe to automate build-file changes:

   ```bash
   mvn rewrite:run -DactiveRecipes=org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.UpgradeSpringBoot_3_2
   ```

   ([OpenRewrite Docs][2])
3. **Apply Spring Boot Migrator (SBM)** to bootstrap conversion from JAX-RS/EJB to Spring Boot conventions:

   ```bash
   java -jar spring-boot-migrator.jar --source kitchensink --target sbm-output
   ```

   SBM lays the groundwork for code migration ([InfoQ][3]).

---

## Phase 1: Extract `util` Package as a Spring Modulith Module

1. **Identify `util` package** classes (e.g., `Resources.java`) and their dependencies.
2. **Create a Spring Modulith** project:

   ```bash
   spring init --dependencies=modulith kitchensink-util
   ```

   Annotate with `@Module(name="util")` and include the extracted classes ([Home][4]).
3. **Enable Java 21 Virtual Threads** for the module by adding in `application.properties`:

   ```properties
   spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true
   ```

   ([Home][5])
4. **Compile & Test** the Modulith module to ensure it builds on Java 21 (`mvn test`).

---

## Phase 2: Data & Service Layer Migration

1. **Migrate JPA Entities**: convert JBoss persistence descriptors to Spring Data JPA repositories (`MemberRepository.java`) ([Stack Overflow][6]).
2. **Refactor EJB & CDI beans** into Spring `@Service` and `@Component` classes, leveraging Spring DI (`@Autowired`, `@Transactional`) ([Ricardo's Notes][7]).
3. **Run OpenRewrite** with the `UpgradeSpringBoot_3_2` recipe on the extracted module to update imports (`javax.persistence` → `jakarta.persistence`) and deprecated APIs ([OpenRewrite Docs][8]).
4. **Generate Unit Tests** via LLM-assisted TestGen-LLM for critical service methods to achieve ≥90% coverage ([Baeldung][9]).
5. **Compile & Integration Test** against shared DB schema using Flyway for schema migrations.

---

## Phase 3: Web Layer & UI Migration

1. **Convert JAX-RS Endpoints** (`MemberResourceRESTService.java`) to Spring MVC `@RestController` or include Jersey starter (`spring-boot-starter-jersey`) if retaining JAX-RS ([Stack Overflow][10]).
2. **Migrate JSF Pages**: either replace with Thymeleaf templates or integrate JSF into Spring Boot using JSF starter examples ([Auth0][11]).
3. **Configure Spring Cloud Gateway** to route `/api/*` to new controllers and `/legacy/*` to the JBoss WAR facade ([vFunction][12]).
4. **Smoke-Test** the combined setup to verify UI and REST flows operate correctly.

---

## Phase 4: Performance & Concurrency with Virtual Threads

1. **Enable Virtual Threads globally**: set `spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true` for all modules.
2. **Refactor Blocking I/O** in service and controller methods to run on virtual threads without explicit executor configuration ([Home][5]).
3. **Benchmark** key flows using JMH to compare thread-per-request vs. virtual threads, monitoring throughput and latency.

---

## Phase 5: Final Cut-Over & Legacy Deprecation

1. **Implement Strangler Fig Facade**: wrap the legacy monolith behind a new Spring Boot façade and progressively switch endpoints to the new modules ([Medium][13]).
2. **Branch-by-Abstraction**: introduce interfaces for core services, with implementations in both legacy and new modules, toggled via feature flags ([vFunction][12]).
3. **Deprecate JBoss WAR**: once all endpoints and pages are migrated, retire the old deployment and replace with the Spring Boot monolith or microservices.
4. **Update Documentation** (`Mermaid` diagrams, module overviews) to reflect the new architecture.

---

This **kitchensink-specific** migration plan—driven by **Spring Modulith**, **OpenRewrite**, **virtual threads**, and **Strangler Fig** tactics—ensures a safe, incremental upgrade to **Spring Boot 3.2 + Java 21**, with clear deliverables and minimal risk.
