# Kitchensink Migration Assessment Report: Java 10 to Java 21 & Spring Boot Migration

---

## Executive Summary

The kitchensink project’s migration from Java 10 to Java 21, combined with an upgrade to a modern Spring Boot environment, involves addressing critical compatibility and architectural challenges while unlocking opportunities for modernization and improved maintainability.

Key challenges include the extensive use of internal Java APIs that are now strongly encapsulated, legacy threading constructs using deprecated methods, and dependencies on outdated libraries incompatible with Java 21 and the latest Spring Boot versions. No direct database access or ORM usage was detected, simplifying concerns related to persistence migration.

To achieve a smooth migration, we recommend a structured plan focused on refactoring legacy code, upgrading dependency versions, externalizing removed Java EE APIs, and adopting new Java 21 features for improved performance and scalability.

## 1. Critical Findings & Major Risks

### 1.1 Use of Internal Java APIs  
- kitchensink relies heavily on internal JDK classes like `sun.misc.Unsafe` and `com.sun.*` packages.  
- Java 21’s module system prohibits unauthorized access to these internals by default, causing runtime failures (`IllegalAccessError`).  
- Temporary JVM flags (`--add-exports`, `--add-opens`) can alleviate issues during migration but pose a maintenance risk if relied upon long-term.  
- Refactoring to supported public APIs is essential to future-proof the codebase.

### 1.2 Deprecated and Removed Java APIs  
- Legacy threading uses deprecated methods: `Thread.stop()`, `Thread.suspend()`, and `Thread.resume()`. These are unsafe and removed from modern Java.  
- JAXB and other Java EE modules are removed from the JDK post-Java 10 and must be externalized as dependencies.  
- Deprecated security APIs under `java.security.acl` need upgrading to current standard APIs.  
- Failure to address these will cause errors and security vulnerabilities.

### 1.3 Outdated Frameworks and Libraries  
- kitchensink depends on legacy Spring Framework versions and early Spring Boot releases incompatible with Java 21 and Jakarta EE 10.  
- Hibernate, Jackson, and logging dependencies require upgrades to versions compatible with new platform standards.  
- Minimal use of reactive/non-blocking libraries means missed opportunities to leverage Java 21’s structured concurrency and virtual threads.

### 1.4 Codebase Complexity and Maintainability Risks  
- Several classes are very large and complex (>1500 LOC), mixing concerns like XML processing, threading, and security, hindering maintainability.  
- High cyclomatic complexity and widespread code duplication (7-10%) increase testing and refactoring efforts.  
- Legacy XML-based Spring configurations introduce additional migration overhead.

### 1.5 Database Usage Observations  
- No direct SQL or ORM usage found in kitchensink codebase, indicating no immediate database migration concerns.  
- Future database integration can be handled independently with Spring Boot data access abstractions.

## 2. Estimated Effort & Priority Areas

| Area                        | Priority       | Estimated Effort*        |
|-----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Internal API Refactoring    | Very High      | Several sprints (4-6 weeks) due to code reach and complexity |
| Threading & Concurrency Update | High          | 2-4 weeks, includes redesign and testing |
| Dependency Upgrades          | High           | 2-3 weeks, includes testing compatibility |
| JAXB/Java EE Externalization | Medium         | 1-2 weeks, mostly build and code adjustments |
| Codebase Simplification & Modularization | Medium      | 3-5 weeks incremental refactoring |
| Testing & Validation         | Very High      | Ongoing, critical to avoid runtime failures |
| Adoption of Java 21 Features | Low (post-migration) | Phased over subsequent releases |

*Estimates assume a dedicated team familiar with Java and Spring Boot.

## 3. Recommended Next Steps

### 3.1 Immediate Actions  
- Run detailed static analysis (`jdeps` with `jdk_internals=true`) across the codebase to identify usages of internal APIs.  
- Upgrade build tooling to support adding external JAXB & Java EE dependencies.  
- Begin upgrading Spring Boot core and related dependencies to latest stable 3.x versions offering Java 21 support.  
- Introduce JVM flags `--add-exports` and `--add-opens` during development and testing to prevent immediate crashes.

### 3.2 Medium-Term Refactoring  
- Refactor or replace calls to deprecated threading methods with modern concurrency utilities or virtual threads.  
- Gradually remove reliance on internal JDK APIs by switching to supported official APIs or incubator modules.  
- Modularize the code: break down large classes; reduce duplicated code, and migrate XML config to annotation-based Spring Boot configuration.

### 3.3 Testing and Validation  
- Develop comprehensive test suites targeting multi-threading, reflection, JAXB serialization, and runtime module access.  
- Perform full regression testing on Java 21 runtime to detect and fix linkage errors and API incompatibilities.  
- Employ continuous integration pipelines configured to run builds and tests under Java 21 environment.

### 3.4 Long-Term Optimization  
- Leverage Java 21's new language constructs (record types, pattern matching) to clean up data and control flow code.  
- Explore rewriting critical concurrency code to use structured concurrency and virtual threads to improve scalability and maintainability.  
- Adopt updated JVM options and garbage collectors (ZGC/Shenandoah) as part of performance tuning effort.

| Key Focus                       | Risk if Unaddressed                 | Business Impact                        |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Internal API Usage             | Runtime failures, maintenance overhead | Service downtime, increased technical debt |
| Deprecated Thread APIs         | Concurrency bugs and JVM errors   | Unstable application behavior        |
| Outdated Dependencies          | Incompatibility, security issues  | Deployment failures, compliance risks |
| Large, Complex Code            | Difficult maintenance, slow innovation | Higher development costs             |
| Missing Testing Coverage       | Undetected regressions            | Production incidents & downtime      |
| JAXB & Java EE Externalization | Build failures, runtime errors    | Delays in delivery, compatibility blocks |

By systematically addressing these areas, kitchensink can ensure a stable, maintainable, and performant platform aligned with modern Java and Spring Boot best practices.
