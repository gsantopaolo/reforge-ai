# kitchensink Migration Executive Summary

---

## Overview

The kitchensink application extensively uses Jakarta EE 10 APIs (`jakarta.*` namespace) for its core functionality including UI (JSF), persistence (JPA), business logic (EJB), REST services (JAX-RS), validation, and dependency injection (CDI). The goal is to modernize kitchensink to run on Java 21 using Spring Boot 3.1.x+ while maintaining robust functionality and improving maintainability.

---

## Critical Points & Major Risks

### Key Compatibility Considerations

- **Jakarta EE 10 Libraries Required:**  
  To run on Java 21, kitchensink must upgrade all Jakarta EE dependencies to versions compatible with Jakarta EE 10. Failure to upgrade will cause runtime errors such as missing classes or API incompatibilities.

- **Namespace Migration:**  
  Any leftover legacy `javax.*` package references must be identified and converted to the new `jakarta.*` namespace. Legacy packages cause class loading conflicts and system failures.

- **Spring Boot Version:**  
  Kitchensink requires an upgrade to at least **Spring Boot 3.1.x**, which fully supports Java 21 and Jakarta EE 10 namespaces. Using older versions will result in incompatibility and deployment failures.

- **Runtime Environment:**  
  The application server or runtime environment must support Jakarta EE 10 APIs and Java 21. Running kitchensink on an older Jakarta EE runtime or Java version will lead to subtle bugs or outright failure.

### Code Quality and Technical Risks

- **Large and Complex Legacy Classes:**  
  Existing EJB session beans and business logic components contain high cyclomatic complexity and mixed responsibilities, making them hard to maintain, test, and migrate.

- **Code Smells and Duplication:**  
  Duplicate validation logic and potential unused imports (especially old `javax.*` packages) increase technical debt and migration complexity.

- **Risk of Runtime Failures:**  
  Without coordinated dependency upgrades, kitchensink is at risk of runtime exceptions such as `ClassNotFoundException`, validation failures, and persistence inconsistencies.

## Effort Estimates & High-Priority Areas

| Task                                        | Complexity / Effort                | Priority         |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|
| Upgrade Jakarta EE dependencies to version 10 | Moderate — involves dependency updates and testing | **High**         |
| Replace all `javax.*` package references      | Small to moderate — automation tools recommended | **High**         |
| Upgrade Spring Boot to 3.1.x+                  | Low to moderate — dependency upgrade and configuration adjustments| **High**         |
| Refactor large EJB and business logic classes  | High — significant code restructuring required | **High**         |
| Migrate REST endpoints and UI layers (JSF → Spring MVC) | Moderate to high — architectural changes needed | **Medium**       |
| Expand automated test coverage                  | Moderate — unit and integration testing needed | **High**         |
| Validate runtime environment compatibility      | Low — verification and possible environment upgrade | **Medium**       |

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Dependency & Namespace Upgrades**  
   - Upgrade all Jakarta EE libraries to Jakarta EE 10 compatible versions supporting the `jakarta.*` namespace.  
   - Use automated migration tools to convert any remaining `javax.*` package imports to `jakarta.*`.  
   - Upgrade Spring Boot to version 3.1.x or later.

2. **Code Refactoring and Modularization**  
   - Decompose large EJB session beans into smaller, modular Spring service components.  
   - Reduce cyclomatic complexity by breaking down complex methods into manageable units.  
   - Remove code duplication by centralizing validation logic and using mapping frameworks like MapStruct.

3. **Persistence Layer Adaptation**  
   - Transition JPA EntityManager usage to Spring Data JPA repositories where appropriate.  
   - Ensure entity classes conform strictly to Jakarta EE 10 annotations.

4. **UI and REST Layer Migration**  
   - Migrate JSF views and managed beans to Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux architectures.  
   - Migrate JAX-RS REST API endpoints to Spring REST controllers.

5. **Testing and Quality Assurance**  
   - Increase unit and integration test coverage targeting migrated components.  
   - Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube) into the CI pipeline to monitor code quality and technical debt.  
   - Perform comprehensive regression and compatibility testing on Java 21 and Jakarta EE 10 runtime environment.

6. **Runtime Environment Validation**  
   - Verify that the deployment environment supports Jakarta EE 10 and Java 21, or move to embedded Spring Boot runtimes for standalone deployment.

## Conclusion

The kitchensink modernization to Spring Boot on Java 21 is achievable with focused efforts on dependency upgrades, namespace migration, and refactoring legacy code, especially EJB-based business logic. Prioritizing testing and runtime environment validation will mitigate migration risks and future-proof kitchensink for maintainability and scalability.

By following the outlined steps, kitchensink will be well-positioned to leverage the latest Java platform features, improved Spring ecosystem support, and longer-term enterprise application stability.
