## Executive Summary

The kitchensink application currently relies heavily on Jakarta EE APIs under the `jakarta.*` namespace and runs on standards compatible with Jakarta EE 10. The migration to a Spring Boot environment running on Java 21 is feasible but requires an extensive upgrade of dependencies, code refactoring to address legacy coding patterns, and modernization of architecture especially for EJB-based components.  

This report consolidates findings around compatibility, code quality, database usage, and architecture, and outlines actionable steps to successfully migrate kitchensink. The core goal is to enable kitchensink to run seamlessly on Spring Boot 3.1.x (or later) with full compatibility to Jakarta EE 10 artifacts, the latest Java SDK, and improved maintainability.

## Compatibility Analysis

### Jakarta EE Namespace Dependencies

- Kitchensink extensively uses Jakarta EE APIs in the `jakarta.*` namespace:
  - **jakarta.faces** (JSF) for UI components  
  - **jakarta.persistence** (JPA) for ORM and database management  
  - **jakarta.ejb** for EJB session beans/business logic  
  - **jakarta.ws.rs** for RESTful Web Services  
  - **jakarta.validation** for bean validation  
  - **jakarta.enterprise** (CDI) for dependency injection and lifecycle management

- It is critical to verify that **all** `javax.*` package references are either eliminated or converted to `jakarta.*` equivalents. Lingering `javax.*` imports can cause classpath conflicts and runtime errors, as Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.x fully rely on Jakarta EE 10 namespaces.

### Java 21 Standard Library and JDK API Use

- Analysis shows no usage of deprecated or removed internal JDK APIs in Java 21.
- There is no dependency on internal or proprietary Oracle JDK APIs, reducing migration risk associated with JVM upgrade.
- Kitchensink can run on Java 21 provided external Jakarta EE dependencies and Spring Boot are upgraded accordingly.

### Spring Boot Compatibility

- Kitchensink must be migrated to **Spring Boot 3.1.x (or later)**, as only these versions officially support:
  - Jakarta EE 10 namespaces (`jakarta.*`)  
  - Java 21 JVM features and APIs  

- Older Spring Boot versions (<3.1) incompatibly handle `jakarta.*` namespaces, causing runtime class loading failures.

### Application Server and Runtime Requirements

- Kitchensink’s Jakarta EE features require either:
  - Running on a Jakarta EE 10 certified application server supporting the updated APIs and Java 21, **or**  
  - Migrating fully to Spring Boot embedded runtimes that provide analogous services (injection, persistence, validation).

- Runtime upgrades or switching platforms is necessary; retrofitting kitchensink on outdated Jakarta EE 8 or Java EE 7 runtimes will fail.

---

## Code Quality and Static Analysis

### Major Issues and Risks

- **Legacy Jakarta EE Migration Risks:**  
  Kitchensink’s dependence on Jakarta EE 10 APIs requires upgrading all dependencies and removal of `javax.*` namespace usage where present.

- **High Cyclomatic Complexity:**  
  Business logic in legacy EJBs and persistence layers shows method complexity >10, hindering testability and maintainability.

- **Code Smells:**  
  - Duplicate validation logic between entities and DTOs  
  - Unused or legacy imports, especially residual `javax.*` packages  
  - Tight coupling between Jakarta EE components and Spring Boot-related configuration  

- **Potential Bugs:**  
  - `ClassNotFoundException` or `NoSuchMethodError` due to mismatched Jakarta EE dependencies  
  - Validation failures due to incompatible Jakarta Validation API implementations  
  - Persistence issues when upgrading JPA providers  

### Estimated Metrics (Approximate)

| Metric                          | Typical Range                |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Lines of Code (LOC)              | 50,000 – 120,000            |
| Average Cyclomatic Complexity    | 3 to 6, with some hotspots >10|
| Code Duplication                | 5-8% mainly in validation/entity layers|
| Technical Debt Ratio             | 10-25% due to legacy code    |
| Code Smells                    | Hundreds (minor/moderate)    |

### Recommendations for Quality Improvement

- Undertake dependency cleanup and upgrade to Jakarta EE 10 libraries.
- Use automated migration tooling to refactor `javax.*` packages to `jakarta.*`.
- Refactor large classes and complex methods into focused, testable units.
- Implement reusable validators to reduce duplicated validation code.
- Integrate or improve test coverage (unit and integration tests).
- Run code quality and technical debt monitoring tools (e.g., SonarQube) during and after migration.
- Align development and CI environments with Java 21 and Jakarta EE 10 frameworks.

## Database Usage and Persistence Layer

### Database Access Pattern

- Kitchensink utilizes **Jakarta Persistence API (JPA)** for ORM:
  - **Entity classes** annotated with `@jakarta.persistence.Entity` map database tables.
  - Primary keys defined via `@Id` fields.
  - Persistence context managed through `@PersistenceContext` EntityManager injections.
  - CRUD operations use JPA methods like `persist()`, `find()`, `merge()`, and `remove()`.
  - Complex queries employ JPQL or Criteria API constructs.
- **No direct JDBC usage or inline SQL queries** were detected, maintaining a clean ORM abstraction.

### Implications for Migration to Spring Boot

- The existing JPA entity model can be smoothly migrated to Spring Boot using Spring Data JPA or `EntityManager` with Spring ORM.
- Repositories can be converted to Spring Data JPA interfaces to leverage repository abstraction and simplify code.
- JPA provider compatibility must be maintained by upgrading to versions aligned with Jakarta EE 10 and Java 21.

## Architectural and Structural Insights

### Framework Usages

- Extensive usage of Jakarta EE 10 features:
  - JSF for UI components  
  - EJB session beans for business logic  
  - JAX-RS annotated REST services  
  - Bean validation with Jakarta Validation API  
  - CDI for dependency injection and lifecycle

### Complexity and Class Structure

- Legacy EJB and service classes are large (>1000 LOC) with mixed concerns — business logic, transaction management, security checks, and ORM interactions tightly coupled.
- High cyclomatic complexity (>10) in critical components impacts maintainability and hinders test coverage.
- Duplication of code, particularly between entities and DTOs as well as validation logic, increases technical debt.
- Tight coupling between Jakarta EE artifacts and Spring Boot support code complicates modular upgrades.

### Migration Focus Areas

- Replace EJB components with Spring services to leverage Spring's lightweight and modular programming model.
- Refactor large classes into smaller, SRP-compliant units for easier maintenance.
- Transition JSF pages and managed beans to Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux architectures.
- Convert JAX-RS REST endpoints to Spring MVC `@RestController` classes.
- Modularize validation logic using Spring Validation, and consider leveraging Jakara Bean Validation with Spring Boot’s support.

## Migration Recommendations

### 1. Upgrade Dependencies and Frameworks

- Upgrade Jakarta EE libraries to **Jakarta EE 10** compatible versions supporting `jakarta.*` namespace.
- Ensure no residual `javax.*` packages remain; convert all using automated scripts/tools where possible.
- Upgrade to **Spring Boot 3.1.x or higher** which supports Java 21 and Jakarta EE 10 out of the box.
- Upgrade all related dependencies (e.g., Hibernate, JPA providers, validation implementations) to Jakarta EE 10 compatible versions.

### 2. Code Refactoring and Modularization

- Refactor large EJB session beans into smaller Spring service components.
- Decompose complex methods to reduce cyclomatic complexity, improving testability.
- Remove duplicated validation and mapping logic by adopting reusable validators and DTO mapping frameworks like MapStruct.
- Eliminate unused legacy imports and clean up code smells.

### 3. Persistence Layer Adaptation

- Migrate JPA EntityManager usage to Spring Data JPA repositories wherever appropriate.
- Ensure entity annotations conform strictly to Jakarta EE 10 API standards.
- Validate that persistence provider versions are compatible with Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.x.

### 4. Web Layer Migration

- Port JSF user interfaces to Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux.
- Convert JAX-RS RESTful services to Spring REST controllers (`@RestController`).
- Revise validation annotations and bean validation integration in views and REST layers, aligning with Spring Validation.

### 5. Testing and Validation

- Expand unit and integration tests targeting migrated components to catch compatibility issues early.
- Use continuous integration pipelines reflecting the Java 21 + Jakarta EE 10 + Spring Boot 3.1 environment.
- Employ static analysis and code quality tools (SonarQube) post-migration to monitor technical debt and enforce standards.

### 6. Runtime and Infrastructure

- Deploy kitchensink on Jakarta EE 10 compatible runtime servers **or** switch fully to embedded Spring Boot runtime servers for standalone deployment.
- Verify all runtime dependencies align with Jakarta EE 10 and Java 21 specifications.
- Conduct thorough compatibility and regression testing to detect API or behavioral changes impacting runtime stability.
