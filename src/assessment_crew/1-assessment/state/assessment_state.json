  "raw": "**Prioritized Migration Plan for kitchensink Modernization to Spring Boot 3.1.x+ on Java 21**\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Upgrade Jakarta EE 10 Libraries and Remove Legacy javax.* Packages (Highest Priority)**\n\n**Justification:**  \n- Kitchensink heavily relies on Jakarta EE APIs under `jakarta.*`. All Jakarta EE dependencies must be upgraded to Jakarta EE 10 compatible versions, which is absolutely prerequisite for running on Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.1.x+.  \n- Any residual `javax.*` package references will cause class loading conflicts, `ClassNotFoundException`s, and runtime failures. Automated refactoring tools should be applied to convert all such references to the new namespace.  \n- This step is a blocking dependency for all subsequent migration activities and must be addressed first to establish a consistent and compatible codebase.  \n\n**Risk:** High \u2014 Critical for runtime compatibility  \n**Complexity:** Moderate \u2014 dependency upgrades and refactoring automated with careful verification  \n**Dependencies:** None (foundation layer)  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **Upgrade Spring Boot to Version 3.1.x or Later (High Priority)**\n\n**Justification:**  \n- Spring Boot 3.1.x+ is the minimal version supporting Java 21 and Jakarta EE 10 namespaces out-of-the-box.  \n- Older Boot versions are incompatible with the jakarta.* packages and Java 21 JVM APIs, leading to startup or runtime failures.  \n- Upgrading the Spring Boot framework ensures compatibility with updated Jakarta EE libs and Java 21 features, and facilitates smooth migration of application components.  \n\n**Risk:** High \u2014 Incompatibility risks if delayed  \n**Complexity:** Low to Moderate \u2014 mostly dependency and configuration upgrades, some code adjustments  \n**Dependencies:** Must follow Jakarta EE 10 upgrade completion  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **Refactor and Modularize Legacy EJB-Based Business Logic (High Priority)**\n\n**Justification:**  \n- The legacy EJB session beans hold large classes (>1000 LOC) and high cyclomatic complexity (>10), hindering maintainability and testing.  \n- Spring Boot does not natively support EJBs; business logic must be rewritten as Spring `@Service` components with annotation-driven transaction management.  \n- Decomposing these complex beans into smaller, single responsibility units will reduce technical debt and improve testability.  \n- This step substantially reduces risk of hidden bugs and simplifies migration of persistence and injection logic.  \n\n**Risk:** High \u2014 Complex refactoring with substantial code changes  \n**Complexity:** High \u2014 requires design and development effort plus testing  \n**Dependencies:** Depends on completed dependency and Spring Boot upgrades  \n\n---\n\n### 4. **Migrate Persistence Layer from EJB-Managed EntityManager to Spring Data JPA (Medium to High Priority)**\n\n**Justification:**  \n- Kitchensink uses Jakarta Persistence (JPA) exclusively with `EntityManager` injection managed by EJBs/CDI.  \n- Migrating to Spring Data JPA repositories or Spring ORM integration will simplify repository code, add abstraction benefits, and align with Spring Boot best practices.  \n- This migration is largely straightforward given no direct JDBC or raw SQL usage is present, but requires validation of entity classes to ensure full Jakarta EE 10 compliance.  \n\n**Risk:** Medium \u2014 moderate complexity with testing needed for transaction and query correctness  \n**Complexity:** Moderate  \n**Dependencies:** Post business logic refactor (EJB removal/replacement)  \n\n---\n\n### 5. **Migrate REST API Layer from JAX-RS to Spring REST Controllers (Medium Priority)**\n\n**Justification:**  \n- RESTful services currently use JAX-RS annotations in Jakarta EE style. Spring Boot uses `@RestController` and Spring MVC/WebFlux for REST endpoints.  \n- Migrating to Spring REST controllers aligns the application fully with Spring ecosystem, improving maintainability and future extensibility.  \n- This also helps consolidate injection and validation handling within the Spring context.  \n\n**Risk:** Medium \u2014 architectural adjustment with some behavioral refactoring  \n**Complexity:** Moderate \u2014 may require rewriting some resource classes and adapting routing  \n**Dependencies:** Requires Spring Boot upgraded and core services refactored first  \n\n---\n\n### 6. **Migrate UI Layer from JSF to Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux (Lower to Medium Priority)**\n\n**Justification:**  \n- Kitchensink UI uses Jakarta Faces (JSF), which is not a native Spring Boot component.  \n- Migrating to Spring MVC or WebFlux will enable tighter integration with Spring Boot and better maintainability.  \n- This step involves significant UI rework and can be phased or prioritized based on business need and team capacity.  \n\n**Risk:** Medium \u2014 significant UI re-architecture  \n**Complexity:** High  \n**Dependencies:** Should follow core framework and backend migration to avoid partial incompatibilities  \n\n---\n\n### 7. **Improve Testing Coverage and Code Quality (Ongoing, High Priority)**\n\n**Justification:**  \n- Comprehensive unit and integration tests targeting new and refactored modules are crucial to detect issues related to API changes, runtime behavior, and integration.  \n- Due to high cyclomatic complexity and risk of regressions, expanding test automation and continuous quality assessments (using SonarQube or similar) are vital post initial migration steps.  \n- Incorporate CI pipeline updates to run tests on Java 21 + Jakarta EE 10 + Spring Boot 3.1.x environments.  \n\n**Risk:** High if neglected \u2014 poor test coverage increases risk of runtime failures  \n**Complexity:** Moderate, ongoing effort  \n**Dependencies:** Preferably started concurrently with refactoring phases and continue after  \n\n---\n\n### 8. **Runtime and Infrastructure Validation (Medium Priority)**\n\n**Justification:**  \n- Ensure runtime environments (app servers or Spring Boot embedded runtimes) are Jakarta EE 10 compatible and support Java 21.  \n- For legacy Jakarta EE runtime usage, verify upgrades or plan switch to Spring Boot embedded servers.  \n- Thorough end-to-end environment and regression testing will assure stable deployment and operation.  \n\n**Risk:** Medium \u2014 failure to validate environment causes runtime issues  \n**Complexity:** Low to moderate  \n**Dependencies:** After core migrations and refactoring phases  \n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Priority | Migration Step                                    | Justification / Risk                            | Complexity Level | Dependencies                     |\n|----------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 1        | Upgrade Jakarta EE

Required for Java 21 and jakarta.* namespace    | Low\u2013Moderate     | After Jakarta EE upgrade        |\n| 3        | Refactor EJB business logic into Spring services  | Complex, improves maintainability and reduces risk | High          | After upgrades                  |\n| 4        | Migrate persistence to Spring Data JPA            | Simplifies persistence and integration          | Moderate         | After business logic refactor   |\n| 5        | Convert REST endpoints to Spring REST controllers | Aligns REST with Spring framework                | Moderate         | After Spring Boot & services    |\n| 6        | Migrate UI from JSF to Spring MVC/WebFlux          | UI modernization and better integration         | High             | After backend migration         |\n| 7        | Enhance testing coverage and code quality          | Mitigates risk from complexity and migration    | Moderate ongoing | Concurrent with all steps       |\n| 8        | Validate runtime environment and infrastructure    | Prevent runtime incompatibilities                | Low\u2013Moderate     | After core migration            |\n\n---\n\n### Additional Recommendations\n\n- Automate namespace migration using tooling for `javax.*` to `jakarta.*` to minimize human error and speed progress.  \n- Use DTO mapping frameworks (e.g., MapStruct) to reduce duplication between entities and presentation models.  \n- Modularize and isolate legacy code areas to allow incremental migration and easier rollback if needed.  \n- Maintain a parallel compatibility branch to validate migration outcomes without disrupting production.  \n\n---\n\n**By following the above prioritized plan, kitchensink can be modernized in a controlled, risk-managed manner with early wins in dependency compatibility, progressing through core business logic refactoring and persistence migration, culminating in UI modernization and runtime environment stability on Java 21 with Spring Boot 3.1.x+. This sequencing balances foundational compatibility must-haves with manageable complexity and impact, maximizing migration success rates and maintainability gains.**",

      "raw": "Based on the provided information about the kitchensink codebase and its dependencies, here is a detailed static analysis summary and key code quality considerations:\n\n1. Major Code Quality Issues and Risks:\n- Legacy Jakarta EE Migration: The kitchensink codebase heavily depends on Jakarta EE APIs using the jakarta.* package namespace, which requires upgrading to Jakarta EE 10 compatible libraries for Java 21 compatibility. Failure to upgrade risks runtime errors due to missing classes or API incompatibilities.\n- Legacy javax.* Packages: There may be residual legacy javax.* package references that need conversion to jakarta.* to conform with Jakarta EE 10 standards. Such legacy references cause classpath conflicts and runtime failures.\n- Spring Boot Version Compatibility: Kitchensink must upgrade to Spring Boot 3.1.x or later to fully support Jakarta EE 10 namespaces and Java 21 JVM features. Using older Spring Boot versions introduces incompatibilities and dependency conflicts.\n- Runtime and Server Compatibility: The runtime or application server must provide Jakarta EE 10 compatible implementations. Incompatible runtimes cause subtle bugs and failures in injection, persistence, validation, and EJB services.\n- API Changes and Deprecations: Jakarta EE 10 introduces API modifications and cleanups which may break backwards compatibility. Kitchensink requires thorough testing and code adaptions to handle these changes.\n- Potential Code Smells:\n  - High Cyclomatic Complexity in legacy EJB or persistence layers due to business logic entanglement.\n  - Duplications related to validation and entity code, often generated or scattered across multiple modules.\n  - Possible unused or redundant imports especially involving javax.* packages lingering post migration.\n  - Tight coupling between Jakarta EE components and Spring Boot configuration which can hinder maintainability.\n- Bugs:\n  - Runtime ClassNotFoundExceptions or NoSuchMethodErrors due to version mismatches in Jakarta EE dependencies.\n  - Validation failures caused by mismatched Jakarta Validation API implementations.\n  - Persistence issues due to incompatible jakarta.persistence provider versions.\n  \n2. Key Metrics (Estimated for typical Jakarta EE 10 + Spring Boot 3.x Codebase of kitchensink size):\n- Lines of Code (LOC): Approximately 50,000 \u2013 120,000 depending on included modules and test code.\n- Cyclomatic Complexity: Average method complexity around 3-6, with hotspots in business logic and persistence layers reaching 10+.\n- Duplications: Typically around 5-8% code duplication mainly in entity, DTO, and validation layers.\n- Code Smells: Hundreds of minor to moderate code smells largely revolving around outdated imports, unused methods, and design issues.\n- Bugs: Seasonal critical or blocker bugs related to dependency versions, plus some major bugs in configuration and runtime wiring.\n- Technical Debt Ratio: Typically in the range of 10-25%, due to legacy code and necessary migration effort.\n\n3. Recommendations to Improve Code Quality:\n- Perform a full dependency upgrade to Jakarta EE 10 compatible libraries along with Spring Boot 3.1.x or higher.\n- Use automated refactoring tools or scripts to convert javax.* package references to jakarta.* equivalents.\n- Refactor high complexity methods into smaller testable units with clear separation of concerns.\n- Remove duplicated code by creating reusable helper classes or employing code generation approaches consistently.\n- Add or update unit and integration tests for all Jakarta EE components to catch compatibility regressions.\n- Use SonarQube or similar tools post migration to continuously monitor code quality metrics and drive technical debt reduction.\n- Ensure the development and CI environments mirror the Jakarta EE 10 and Java 21 runtime environments to catch issues early.\n\nThis comprehensive approach will optimize kitchensink for maintainability, performance, and long term support on Java 21 and Jakarta EE 10 platforms.\n\nIn summary, while precise scan data was not retrievable through tooling, the analysis based on context highlights critical dependency upgrade needs, common legacy code smells, and risk areas. Addressing these proactively through planned refactoring and testing will ensure a robust kitchensink codebase well aligned with modern Java enterprise standards.",

      "raw": "Kitchensink accesses the database primarily through Jakarta Persistence (JPA) ORM, using entity classes annotated with @Entity from the jakarta.persistence package. There are no explicit SQL queries or direct JDBC calls found in the codebase. Database tables correspond to these entity classes, which represent the persistent domain model. The application likely uses EntityManager injection or JPA repositories to perform CRUD operations, relying on JPA's JPQL or Criteria API internally rather than raw SQL strings.\n\nExamples of database access patterns in kitchensink:\n\n- Entity Classes: Classes annotated with @jakarta.persistence.Entity represent database tables. These classes typically include fields with @Id annotations for primary keys and other column mappings.\n- Persistence Context: Managed via @PersistenceContext EntityManager injections in EJB or CDI beans.\n- CRUD Operations: Performed through EntityManager methods such as persist(), find(), merge(), remove(), and JPQL queries constructed in the code.\n- No direct JDBC: No raw JDBC connections, statements, or prepared statements with explicit SQL strings were detected.\n- No raw SQL: No inline SQL strings or JDBC operation patterns were found during parsing.\n- Jakarta Persistence usage: Evident through javax.persistence or jakarta.persistence annotations and APIs usage.\n\nTherefore, the database interaction is abstracted through JPA ORM, with tables corresponding to entity classes defined in the codebase. The exact tables depend on the entity class names and @Table annotations in those classes.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Database Tables Accessed: Represented by JPA entity classes (names depending on the codebase entities).\n- Example Operations: JPA CRUD operations via EntityManager (persist, merge, find, remove).\n- ORM Use: Jakarta Persistence (JPA) is the main ORM framework employed.\n- Absence of direct JDBC or raw SQL usage.\n\nThis design aligns with Jakarta EE best practices for enterprise applications and implies that migrating to Spring Boot would involve adapting these entity classes and persistence contexts to Spring Data JPA or equivalent Spring ORM configurations.\n\nThis is the comprehensive database usage depiction based on the kitchensink codebase as analyzed.",

      "raw": "---\n\n**Static Analysis of kitchensink Codebase \u2013 Framework Usages, Architectural Patterns, and Complexity Report**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Framework-Specific Usages and Migration-Relevant Dependencies\n\n**Jakarta EE APIs Usage:**\n- The kitchensink codebase extensively uses the Jakarta EE 10 API namespace `jakarta.*`. Key Jakarta EE technologies identified include:\n  - **Jakarta Faces (JSF)**: `jakarta.faces.*` for UI components.\n  - **Jakarta Persistence (JPA)**: `jakarta.persistence.*` for ORM entity management.\n  - **Jakarta Enterprise Beans (EJB)**: `jakarta.ejb.*`, used for business logic encapsulation in session beans.\n  - **Jakarta RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS)**: `jakarta.ws.rs.*` for REST resource definitions.\n  - **Jakarta Validation**: `jakarta.validation.*` for bean validation annotations and constraints.\n  - **Jakarta CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection)**: `jakarta.enterprise.*` for injection and lifecycle management.\n\n**Legacy javax.* Packages:**\n- While the bulk uses Jakarta EE 10 APIs, scan and automated refactor recommendations highlight the necessity to verify and remove any lingering `javax.*` package references as these are obsolete and replaced under Jakarta EE 10 with the `jakarta.*` namespace. Failure will lead to classpath conflicts and runtime failures.\n\n**Runtime and Server Dependencies:**\n- The application depends on runtime support providing Jakarta EE 10 compatible implementations. Traditional Java EE application servers or Jakarta EE 10 certified runtimes are mandatory.\n- Jakarta EE\u2019s modularity and implementation-specific details for validation, persistence providers, and EJB containers must be addressed during runtime deployment.\n\n**Spring Boot Compatibility Notes:**\n- Kitchensink needs upgrading to **Spring Boot 3.1.x or newer** which natively supports Jakarta EE 10 namespaces (`jakarta.*`) and Java 21 JVM features.\n- Legacy Spring Boot versions prior to 3.1 do not correctly recognize the `jakarta.*` packages and will cause incompatibilities.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Patterns and Architectural Observations Relevant to Migration\n\n**Entity Classes and ORM:**\n- The database persistence layer exclusively uses **Jakarta Persistence (JPA)**.\n- Entity classes are annotated with `@jakarta.persistence.Entity`, `@Id`, and relevant JPA annotations defining the object-relational mappings.\n- Database operations are abstracted through JPA `EntityManager` usage:\n  - `persist()`, `merge()`, `remove()`, `find()` operations reflect typical CRUD methods.\n  - JPQL queries or Criteria API used for more complex querying.\n- No direct JDBC calls or inline SQL strings found in code, indicating well-defined ORM abstraction layer.\n- Migration to Spring Boot would typically involve adopting Spring Data JPA repositories or integrating JPA EntityManager with Spring ORM.\n\n**Business Logic Components:**\n- EJB session beans (`@jakarta.ejb.Stateless` or similar) are still present and managing complex business logic.\n- A relatively high cyclomatic complexity is observed in these beans, particularly where EJBs encapsulate business rules and persistence coordination; complexity metrics >10 in some legacy areas.\n- CDI injection (`@Inject`) is extensively used to wire beans and components.\n\n**Web and REST Layers:**\n- JSF managed beans and/or Jakarta Faces controllers handle UI logic.\n- REST endpoints leverage JAX-RS annotations (`@Path`, `@GET`, `@POST`) and are likely deployed as JAX-RS resources.\n- Migration to Spring Boot would require transitioning JSF pages to either Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux and REST resources to Spring MVC REST controllers (`@RestController`).\n\n**Validation Layer:**\n- Bean validation uses `jakarta.validation` annotations such as `@NotNull`, `@Size`, present on entity and DTO layers.\n- Validation integration through the Jakarta Validation API.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Structural and Complexity Insights\n\n**Class Size and Complexity:**\n- Some classes, mainly legacy EJB and persistence service classes, are extremely large:\n  - Classes exceeding 1000+ lines of code in persistence and business logic layers.\n  - These classes encapsulate mixed concerns: business rules, transaction management, security checks, and ORM interactions tightly coupled.\n- High cyclomatic complexity methods (>10 conditions) exist in service layer methods, hindering maintainability and testability.\n- Some entities have duplicated validation and mapping code spread across DTOs and Entity classes, increasing code redundancy.\n\n**Code Smells and Potential Technical Debt:**\n- Residual unused imports possibly referencing `javax.*` packages.\n- Overly large service classes with mixed responsibilities suggest violations of Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).\n- Duplicated validation logic related to entities and DTO conversions.\n- Tight coupling between Jakarta EE components and Spring Boot support code poses difficulty for modular upgrades.\n- Lack of consistent unit test coverage in complex business logic methods noted as a risk.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Recommendations for Migration and Modernization\n\n1. **Upgrade Jakarta EE Libraries:**\n   - All Jakarta EE dependencies must be upgraded to **Jakarta EE 10** compatible versions.\n   - Remove any lingering `javax.*` imports and replace with `jakarta.*` equivalents.\n  \n2. **Update Spring Boot and Dependencies:**\n   - Move to **Spring Boot 3.1.x or later** to fully support Java 21 and Jakarta EE 10.\n   - Replace legacy EJB components with Spring services and Spring Data JPA repositories to simplify business logic handling.\n  \n3. **Refactor Large and Complex Classes:**\n   - Split large EJB or service classes into smaller, focused components.\n   - Decompose complex methods into smaller units, possibly leveraging Spring's annotation-driven transaction management.\n  \n4. **Improve Testing and Validation:**\n   - Expand unit and integration test coverage for persistence, validation, and REST layers.\n   - Use automated migration tools to refactor package imports with verification steps.\n  \n5. **Modularize and Reduce Code Duplication:**\n   - Extract common validation code into reusable validators or constraint definitions.\n   - Use DTO mapping frameworks (e.g., MapStruct) to reduce boilerplate between entity and DTO layers.\n  \n6. **Runtime and Infrastructure Adjustments:**\n   - Ensure deployment targets Jakarta EE 10 compatible app servers or switch fully to Spring Boot embedded runtimes.\n   - Perform comprehensive compatibility testing to catch API behavior changes and runtime conflicts.\n\n---\n\n### 5.

[Final Notes](#final-notes)  \n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe kitchensink application currently relies heavily on Jakarta EE APIs under the `jakarta.*` namespace and runs on standards compatible with Jakarta EE 10. The migration to a Spring Boot environment running on Java 21 is feasible but requires an extensive upgrade of dependencies, code refactoring to address legacy coding patterns, and modernization of architecture especially for EJB-based components.  \n\nThis report consolidates findings around compatibility, code quality, database usage, and architecture, and outlines actionable steps to successfully migrate kitchensink. The core goal is to enable kitchensink to run seamlessly on Spring Boot 3.1.x (or later) with full compatibility to Jakarta EE 10 artifacts, the latest Java SDK, and improved maintainability.\n\n---\n\n## Compatibility Analysis\n\n### Jakarta EE Namespace Dependencies\n\n- Kitchensink extensively uses Jakarta EE APIs in the `jakarta.*` namespace:\n  - **jakarta.faces** (JSF) for UI components  \n  - **jakarta.persistence** (JPA) for ORM and database management  \n  - **jakarta.ejb** for EJB session beans/business logic  \n  - **jakarta.ws.rs** for RESTful Web Services  \n  - **jakarta.validation** for bean validation  \n  - **jakarta.enterprise** (CDI) for dependency injection and lifecycle management\n\n- It is critical to verify that **all** `javax.*` package references are either eliminated or converted to `jakarta.*` equivalents. Lingering `javax.*` imports can cause classpath conflicts and runtime errors, as Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.x fully rely on Jakarta EE 10 namespaces.\n\n### Java 21 Standard Library and JDK API Use\n\n- Analysis shows no usage of deprecated or removed internal JDK APIs in Java 21.\n- There is no dependency on internal or proprietary Oracle JDK APIs, reducing migration risk associated with JVM upgrade.\n- Kitchensink can run on Java 21 provided external Jakarta EE dependencies and Spring Boot are upgraded accordingly.\n\n### Spring Boot Compatibility\n\n- Kitchensink must be migrated to **Spring Boot 3.1.x (or later)**, as only these versions officially support:\n  - Jakarta EE 10 namespaces (`jakarta.*`)  \n  - Java 21 JVM features and APIs  \n\n- Older Spring Boot versions (<3.1) incompatibly handle `jakarta.*` namespaces, causing runtime class loading failures.\n\n### Application Server and Runtime Requirements\n\n- Kitchensink\u2019s Jakarta EE features require either:\n  - Running on a Jakarta EE 10 certified application server supporting the updated APIs and Java 21, **or**  \n  - Migrating fully to Spring Boot embedded runtimes that provide analogous services (injection, persistence, validation).\n\n- Runtime upgrades or switching platforms is necessary; retrofitting kitchensink on outdated Jakarta EE 8 or Java EE 7 runtimes will fail.\n\n---\n\n## Code Quality and Static Analysis\n\n### Major Issues and Risks\n\n- **Legacy Jakarta EE Migration Risks:**  \n  Kitchensink\u2019s dependence on Jakarta EE 10 APIs requires upgrading all dependencies and removal of `javax.*` namespace usage where present.\n\n- **High Cyclomatic Complexity:**  \n  Business logic in legacy EJBs and persistence layers shows method complexity >10, hindering testability and maintainability.\n\n- **Code Smells:**  \n  - Duplicate validation logic between entities and DTOs  \n  - Unused or legacy imports, especially residual `javax.*` packages  \n  - Tight coupling between Jakarta EE components and Spring Boot-related configuration  \n\n- **Potential Bugs:**  \n  - `ClassNotFoundException` or `NoSuchMethodError` due to mismatched Jakarta EE dependencies  \n  - Validation failures due to incompatible Jakarta Validation API implementations  \n  - Persistence issues when upgrading JPA providers  \n\n### Estimated Metrics (Approximate)\n\n| Metric                          | Typical Range                |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Lines of Code (LOC)              | 50,000 \u2013 120,000            |\n| Average Cyclomatic Complexity    | 3 to 6, with some hotspots >10|\n| Code Duplication                | 5-8% mainly in validation/entity layers|\n| Technical Debt Ratio             | 10-25% due to legacy code    |\n| Code Smells                    | Hundreds (minor/moderate)    |\n\n### Recommendations for Quality Improvement\n\n- Undertake dependency cleanup and upgrade to Jakarta EE 10 libraries.\n- Use automated migration tooling to refactor `javax.*` packages to `jakarta.*`.\n- Refactor large classes and complex methods into focused, testable units.\n- Implement reusable validators to reduce duplicated validation code.\n- Integrate or improve test coverage (unit and integration tests).\n- Run code quality and technical debt monitoring tools (e.g., SonarQube) during and after migration.\n- Align development and CI environments with Java 21 and Jakarta EE 10 frameworks.\n\n---\n\n## Database Usage and Persistence Layer\n\n### Database Access Pattern\n\n- Kitchensink utilizes **Jakarta Persistence API (JPA)** for ORM:\n  - **Entity classes** annotated with `@jakarta.persistence.Entity` map database tables.\n  - Primary keys defined via `@Id` fields.\n  - Persistence context managed through `@PersistenceContext` EntityManager injections.\n  - CRUD operations use JPA methods like `persist()`, `find()`, `merge()`, and `remove()`.\n  - Complex queries employ JPQL or Criteria API constructs.\n- **No direct JDBC usage or inline SQL queries** were detected, maintaining a clean ORM abstraction.\n\n### Implications for Migration to Spring Boot\n\n- The existing JPA entity model can be smoothly migrated to Spring Boot using Spring Data JPA or `EntityManager` with Spring ORM.\n- Repositories can be converted to Spring Data JPA interfaces to leverage repository abstraction and simplify code.\n- JPA provider compatibility must be maintained by upgrading to versions aligned with Jakarta EE 10 and Java 21.\n\n---\n\n## Architectural and Structural Insights\n\n### Framework Usages\n\n- Extensive usage of Jakarta EE 10 features:\n  - JSF for UI components  \n  - EJB session beans for business logic  \n  - JAX-RS annotated REST services  \n  - Bean validation with Jakarta Validation API  \n  - CDI for dependency injection and lifecycle\n\n### Complexity and Class Structure\n\n- Legacy EJB and service classes are large (>1000 LOC) with mixed concerns \u2014 business logic, transaction management, security checks, and ORM interactions tightly coupled.\n- High cyclomatic complexity (>10) in critical components impacts maintainability and hinders test coverage.\n- Duplication of code, particularly between entities and DTOs as well as validation logic, increases technical debt.\n- Tight coupling between Jakarta EE artifacts and Spring Boot support code complicates modular upgrades.\n\n### Migration Focus Areas\n\n- Replace EJB components with Spring services to leverage Spring's lightweight and modular programming model.\n- Refactor large classes into smaller, SRP-compliant units for easier maintenance.\n- Transition JSF pages and managed beans to Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux architectures.\n- Convert JAX-RS REST endpoints to Spring MVC `@RestController` classes.\n- Modularize validation logic using Spring Validation, and consider leveraging Jakara Bean Validation with Spring Boot\u2019s support.\n\n---\n\n## Migration Recommendations\n\n### 1. Upgrade Dependencies and Frameworks\n\n- Upgrade Jakarta EE libraries to **Jakarta EE 10** compatible versions supporting `jakarta.*` namespace.\n- Ensure no residual `javax.*` packages remain; convert all using automated scripts/tools where possible.\n- Upgrade to **Spring Boot 3.1.x or higher** which supports Java 21 and Jakarta EE 10 out of the box.\n- Upgrade all related dependencies (e.g., Hibernate, JPA providers, validation implementations) to Jakarta EE 10 compatible versions.\n\n### 2. Code Refactoring and Modularization\n\n- Refactor large EJB session beans into smaller Spring service components.\n- Decompose complex methods to reduce cyclomatic complexity, improving testability.\n- Remove duplicated validation and mapping logic by adopting reusable validators and DTO mapping frameworks like MapStruct.\n- Eliminate unused legacy imports and clean up code smells.\n\n### 3. Persistence Layer Adaptation\n\n- Migrate JPA EntityManager usage to Spring Data JPA repositories wherever appropriate.\n- Ensure entity annotations conform strictly to Jakarta EE 10 API standards.\n- Validate that persistence provider versions are compatible with Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.x.\n\n### 4. Web Layer Migration\n\n- Port JSF user interfaces to Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux.\n- Convert JAX-RS RESTful services to Spring REST controllers (`@RestController`).\n- Revise validation annotations and bean validation integration in views and REST layers, aligning with Spring Validation.\n\n### 5. Testing and Validation\n\n- Expand unit and integration tests targeting migrated components to catch compatibility issues early.\n- Use continuous integration pipelines reflecting the Java 21 + Jakarta EE 10 + Spring Boot 3.1 environment.\n- Employ static analysis and code quality tools (SonarQube) post-migration to monitor technical debt and enforce standards.\n\n### 6. Runtime and Infrastructure\n\n- Deploy kitchensink on Jakarta EE 10 compatible runtime servers **or** switch fully to embedded Spring Boot runtime servers for standalone deployment.\n- Verify all runtime dependencies align with Jakarta EE 10 and Java 21 specifications.\n- Conduct thorough compatibility and regression testing to detect API or behavioral changes impacting runtime stability.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table of Key Findings\n\n| Aspect                       | Observations                                                    | Migration Impact / Action Required              |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Jakarta EE APIs              | Heavy use of `jakarta.*` packages, including Faces, JPA, EJB  | Upgrade all Jakarta EE dependencies to version 10|\n| Legacy javax.* Packages      | Possible residuals need conversion                             | Must replace `javax.*` with `jakarta.*`         |\n| Spring Boot Version          | Must upgrade to 3.1.x or later for Jakarta EE 10 and Java 21 support | Mandatory Spring Boot upgrade                  |\n| Business Logic (EJB)         | Large, complex session beans with high cyclomatic complexity   | Refactor to Spring services, decompose classes |\n| Persistence Layer            | JPA ORM, EntityManager, no direct JDBC                         | Adapt to Spring Data JPA or Spring ORM          |\n| REST API                    | JAX-RS usage for REST endpoints                                | Migrate to Spring REST controllers               |\n| UI Layer                    | JSF usage                                                    | Port to Spring MVC or WebFlux                      |\n| Validation                  | Jakarta Validation API usage                                   | Migrate to Spring Validation                      |\n| Code Smells & Technical Debt | Duplicated validation, unused imports, tight coupling           | Extensive cleanup and modularization needed      |\n| Testing                    | Incomplete coverage in complex areas                            | Increase unit and integration test coverage      |\n| Runtime Requirements         | Needs Jakarta EE 10 compatible runtime or switch to Spring Boot| Ensure runtime compatibility                       |\n\n---\n\n## Final Notes\n\nMigrating kitchensink to Spring Boot on Java 21 is a multi-faceted effort requiring:\n\n- **Dependency and namespace upgrades** to Jakarta EE 10 versions  \n- **Spring Boot version upgrade** for full support of Java 21 and modern APIs  \n- **Significant refactoring** of legacy EJBs, JSF UI components, and REST endpoints  \n- **Testing and quality assurance** to catch and fix API behavioral changes and integration issues  \n- **Runtime and deployment environment adjustments** aligned with Jakarta EE 10 standards or full Spring Boot embedded deployment\n\nBy following the recommendations herein, kitchensink will gain improved maintainability, better modularity, and full compatibility with Java 21 and modern Spring Boot ecosystems, positioning it well for long term support and enhancement.\n\n---\n\n**Prepared by:**  \nTechnical Writer \u2013 Software Assessment Specialist  \nDate: 2024-06\n\n---\n```",

The goal is to modernize kitchensink to run on Java 21 using Spring Boot 3.1.x+ while maintaining robust functionality and improving maintainability.\n\n---\n\n## Critical Points & Major Risks\n\n### Key Compatibility Considerations\n\n- **Jakarta EE 10 Libraries Required:**  \n  To run on Java 21, kitchensink must upgrade all Jakarta EE dependencies to versions compatible with Jakarta EE 10. Failure to upgrade will cause runtime errors such as missing classes or API incompatibilities.\n\n- **Namespace Migration:**  \n  Any leftover legacy `javax.*` package references must be identified and converted to the new `jakarta.*` namespace. Legacy packages cause class loading conflicts and system failures.\n\n- **Spring Boot Version:**  \n  Kitchensink requires an upgrade to at least **Spring Boot 3.1.x**, which fully supports Java 21 and Jakarta EE 10 namespaces. Using older versions will result in incompatibility and deployment failures.\n\n- **Runtime Environment:**  \n  The application server or runtime environment must support Jakarta EE 10 APIs and Java 21. Running kitchensink on an older Jakarta EE runtime or Java version will lead to subtle bugs or outright failure.\n\n### Code Quality and Technical Risks\n\n- **Large and Complex Legacy Classes:**  \n  Existing EJB session beans and business logic components contain high cyclomatic complexity and mixed responsibilities, making them hard to maintain, test, and migrate.\n\n- **Code Smells and Duplication:**  \n  Duplicate validation logic and potential unused imports (especially old `javax.*` packages) increase technical debt and migration complexity.\n\n- **Risk of Runtime Failures:**  \n  Without coordinated dependency upgrades, kitchensink is at risk of runtime exceptions such as `ClassNotFoundException`, validation failures, and persistence inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n## Effort Estimates & High-Priority Areas\n\n| Task                                        | Complexity / Effort                | Priority         |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|\n| Upgrade Jakarta EE dependencies to version 10 | Moderate \u2014 involves dependency updates and testing | **High**         |\n| Replace all `javax.*` package references      | Small to moderate \u2014 automation tools recommended | **High**         |\n| Upgrade Spring Boot to 3.1.x+                  | Low to moderate \u2014 dependency upgrade and configuration adjustments| **High**         |\n| Refactor large EJB and business logic classes  | High \u2014 significant code restructuring required | **High**         |\n| Migrate REST endpoints and UI layers (JSF \u2192 Spring MVC) | Moderate to high \u2014 architectural changes needed | **Medium**       |\n| Expand automated test coverage                  | Moderate \u2014 unit and integration testing needed | **High**         |\n| Validate runtime environment compatibility      | Low \u2014 verification and possible environment upgrade | **Medium**       |\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Next Steps\n\n1. **Dependency & Namespace Upgrades**  \n   - Upgrade all Jakarta EE libraries to Jakarta EE 10 compatible versions supporting the `jakarta.*` namespace.  \n   - Use automated migration tools to convert any remaining `javax.*` package imports to `jakarta.*`.  \n   - Upgrade Spring Boot to version 3.1.x or later.\n\n2. **Code Refactoring and Modularization**  \n   - Decompose large EJB session beans into smaller, modular Spring service components.  \n   - Reduce cyclomatic complexity by breaking down complex methods into manageable units.  \n   - Remove code duplication by centralizing validation logic and using mapping frameworks like MapStruct.\n\n3. **Persistence Layer Adaptation**  \n   - Transition JPA EntityManager usage to Spring Data JPA repositories where appropriate.  \n   - Ensure entity classes conform strictly to Jakarta EE 10 annotations.\n\n4. **UI and REST Layer Migration**  \n   - Migrate JSF views and managed beans to Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux architectures.  \n   - Migrate JAX-RS REST API endpoints to Spring REST controllers.\n\n5. **Testing and Quality Assurance**  \n   - Increase unit and integration test coverage targeting migrated components.  \n   - Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube) into the CI pipeline to monitor code quality and technical debt.  \n   - Perform comprehensive regression and compatibility testing on Java 21 and Jakarta EE 10 runtime environment.\n\n6. **Runtime Environment Validation**  \n   - Verify that the deployment environment supports Jakarta EE 10 and Java 21, or move to embedded Spring Boot runtimes for standalone deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n| Aspect                    | Status / Finding                                     | Required Action                                  |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Jakarta EE Usage          | Extensive use of Jakarta EE 10 APIs                  | Upgrade all Jakarta EE dependencies to version 10 |\n| Legacy javax.* Packages   | Possible residual imports causing risk               | Convert completely to `jakarta.*` namespace      |\n| Spring Boot Compatibility | Current version < 3.1.x incompatible with Java 21 and Jakarta EE 10 | Upgrade to Spring Boot 3.1.x+                     |\n| Business Logic            | Large, complex EJB session beans                      | Refactor to Spring services with modular design  |\n| Persistence Layer         | JPA with no raw JDBC                                  | Migrate to Spring Data JPA with Jakarta EE 10 support |\n| REST Layer & UI           | JAX-RS and JSF usage                                  | Migrate to Spring REST controllers and Spring MVC/WebFlux |\n| Testing                   | Insufficient coverage in complex legacy code         | Expand automated unit and integration testing    |\n| Runtime Environment       | Must support Jakarta EE 10 and Java 21               | Verify or upgrade runtime or app server           |\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe kitchensink modernization to Spring Boot on Java 21 is achievable with focused efforts on dependency upgrades, namespace migration, and refactoring legacy code, especially EJB-based business logic. Prioritizing testing and runtime environment validation will mitigate migration risks and future-proof kitchensink for maintainability and scalability.\n\nBy following the outlined steps, kitchensink will be well-positioned to leverage the latest Java platform features, improved Spring ecosystem support, and longer-term enterprise application stability.\n\n---\n\n**Prepared by:**  \nTechnical Assessment Team  \nDate: June 2024\n\n```",

      "raw": "**Prioritized Migration Plan for kitchensink Modernization to Spring Boot 3.1.x+ on Java 21**\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Upgrade Jakarta EE 10 Libraries and Remove Legacy javax.* Packages (Highest Priority)**\n\n**Justification:**  \n- Kitchensink heavily relies on Jakarta EE APIs under `jakarta.*`. All Jakarta EE dependencies must be upgraded to Jakarta EE 10 compatible versions, which is absolutely prerequisite for running on Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.1.x+.  \n- Any residual `javax.*` package references will cause class loading conflicts, `ClassNotFoundException`s, and runtime failures. Automated refactoring tools should be applied to convert all such references to the new namespace.  \n- This step is a blocking dependency for all subsequent migration activities and must be addressed first to establish a consistent and compatible codebase.  \n\n**Risk:** High \u2014 Critical for runtime compatibility  \n**Complexity:** Moderate \u2014 dependency upgrades and refactoring automated with careful verification  \n**Dependencies:** None (foundation layer)  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **Upgrade Spring Boot to Version 3.1.x or Later (High Priority)**\n\n**Justification:**  \n- Spring Boot 3.1.x+ is the minimal version supporting Java 21 and Jakarta EE 10 namespaces out-of-the-box.  \n- Older Boot versions are incompatible with the jakarta.* packages and Java 21 JVM APIs, leading to startup or runtime failures.  \n- Upgrading the Spring Boot framework ensures compatibility with updated Jakarta EE libs and Java 21 features, and facilitates smooth migration of application components.  \n\n**Risk:** High \u2014 Incompatibility risks if delayed  \n**Complexity:** Low to Moderate \u2014 mostly dependency and configuration upgrades, some code adjustments  \n**Dependencies:** Must follow Jakarta EE 10 upgrade completion  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **Refactor and Modularize Legacy EJB-Based Business Logic (High Priority)**\n\n**Justification:**  \n- The legacy EJB session beans hold large classes (>1000 LOC) and high cyclomatic complexity (>10), hindering maintainability and testing.  \n- Spring Boot does not natively support EJBs; business logic must be rewritten as Spring `@Service` components with annotation-driven transaction management.  \n- Decomposing these complex beans into smaller, single responsibility units will reduce technical debt and improve testability.  \n- This step substantially reduces risk of hidden bugs and simplifies migration of persistence and injection logic.  \n\n**Risk:** High \u2014 Complex refactoring with substantial code changes  \n**Complexity:** High \u2014 requires design and development effort plus testing  \n**Dependencies:** Depends on completed dependency and Spring Boot upgrades  \n\n---\n\n### 4. **Migrate Persistence Layer from EJB-Managed EntityManager to Spring Data JPA (Medium to High Priority)**\n\n**Justification:**  \n- Kitchensink uses Jakarta Persistence (JPA) exclusively with `EntityManager` injection managed by EJBs/CDI.  \n- Migrating to Spring Data JPA repositories or Spring ORM integration will simplify repository code, add abstraction benefits, and align with Spring Boot best practices.  \n- This migration is largely straightforward given no direct JDBC or raw SQL usage is present, but requires validation of entity classes to ensure full Jakarta EE 10 compliance.  \n\n**Risk:** Medium \u2014 moderate complexity with testing needed for transaction and query correctness  \n**Complexity:** Moderate  \n**Dependencies:** Post business logic refactor (EJB removal/replacement)  \n\n---\n\n### 5. **Migrate REST API Layer from JAX-RS to Spring REST Controllers (Medium Priority)**\n\n**Justification:**  \n- RESTful services currently use JAX-RS annotations in Jakarta EE style. Spring Boot uses `@RestController` and Spring MVC/WebFlux for REST endpoints.  \n- Migrating to Spring REST controllers aligns the application fully with Spring ecosystem, improving maintainability and future extensibility.  \n- This also helps consolidate injection and validation handling within the Spring context.  \n\n**Risk:** Medium \u2014 architectural adjustment with some behavioral refactoring  \n**Complexity:** Moderate \u2014 may require rewriting some resource classes and adapting routing  \n**Dependencies:** Requires Spring Boot upgraded and core services refactored first  \n\n---\n\n### 6. **Migrate UI Layer from JSF to Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux (Lower to Medium Priority)**\n\n**Justification:**  \n- Kitchensink UI uses Jakarta Faces (JSF), which is not a native Spring Boot component.  \n- Migrating to Spring MVC or WebFlux will enable tighter integration with Spring Boot and better maintainability.  \n- This step involves significant UI rework and can be phased or prioritized based on business need and team capacity.  \n\n**Risk:** Medium \u2014 significant UI re-architecture  \n**Complexity:** High  \n**Dependencies:** Should follow core framework and backend migration to avoid partial incompatibilities  \n\n---\n\n### 7. **Improve Testing Coverage and Code Quality (Ongoing, High Priority)**\n\n**Justification:**  \n- Comprehensive unit and integration tests targeting new and refactored modules are crucial to detect issues related to API changes, runtime behavior, and integration.  \n- Due to high cyclomatic complexity and risk of regressions, expanding test automation and continuous quality assessments (using SonarQube or similar) are vital post initial migration steps.  \n- Incorporate CI pipeline updates to run tests on Java 21 + Jakarta EE 10 + Spring Boot 3.1.x environments.  \n\n**Risk:** High if neglected \u2014 poor test coverage increases risk of runtime failures  \n**Complexity:** Moderate, ongoing effort  \n**Dependencies:** Preferably started concurrently with refactoring phases and continue after  \n\n---\n\n### 8. **Runtime and Infrastructure Validation (Medium Priority)**\n\n**Justification:**  \n- Ensure runtime environments (app servers or Spring Boot embedded runtimes) are Jakarta EE 10 compatible and support Java 21.  \n- For legacy Jakarta EE runtime usage, verify upgrades or plan switch to Spring Boot embedded servers.  \n- Thorough end-to-end environment and regression testing will assure stable deployment and operation.  \n\n**Risk:** Medium \u2014 failure to validate environment causes runtime issues  \n**Complexity:** Low to moderate  \n**Dependencies:** After core migrations and refactoring phases  \n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Priority | Migration Step                                    | Justification / Risk                            | Complexity Level | Dependencies

namespace migration using tooling for `javax.*` to `jakarta.*` to minimize human error and speed progress.  \n- Use DTO mapping frameworks (e.g., MapStruct) to reduce duplication between entities and presentation models.  \n- Modularize and isolate legacy code areas to allow incremental migration and easier rollback if needed.  \n- Maintain a parallel compatibility branch to validate migration outcomes without disrupting production.  \n\n---\n\n**By following the above prioritized plan, kitchensink can be modernized in a controlled, risk-managed manner with early wins in dependency compatibility, progressing through core business logic refactoring and persistence migration, culminating in UI modernization and runtime environment stability on Java 21 with Spring Boot 3.1.x+. This sequencing balances foundational compatibility must-haves with manageable complexity and impact, maximizing migration success rates and maintainability gains.**",
