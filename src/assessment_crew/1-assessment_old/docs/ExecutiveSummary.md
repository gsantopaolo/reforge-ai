# kitchensink Migration Executive Summary  
**Migration Target:** Java 21 & Spring Boot 3.x  
**Date:** June 2024  

---

## Overview

The kitchensink codebase, currently running on Java 10 and legacy Spring Boot versions, requires modernization to fully support Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.x. This upgrade is critical to maintain security, stability, and leverage new platform capabilities.

Our assessment highlights key challenges, major risks, estimated effort, and prioritized next steps for a successful migration.

## Key Findings & Major Risks

### 1. Heavy Reliance on Internal JDK APIs  
- Kitchensink uses low-level internal Java APIs (e.g., `sun.misc.Unsafe`) no longer accessible in Java 21.  
- This causes compile-time errors and runtime failures under strict module encapsulation in Java 21.  
- Temporary JVM flags (`--add-opens`) can help but are not a sustainable solution.

### 2. Dependencies on Removed Java EE Modules  
- Legacy use of JAXB, CORBA, and JAX-WS modules that were removed from the JDK after Java 9.  
- Without adding explicit external dependencies or migrating to Jakarta EE equivalents, runtime crashes will occur.

### 3. Outdated Spring Framework and Related Libraries  
- Kitchensink uses Spring Boot prior to 3.x and Spring Framework 5.x or earlier, incompatible with Java 21.  
- Many third-party libraries (Hibernate, Jackson, Guava) are outdated and incompatible, posing risks of runtime failures.

### 4. Code Complexity and Maintainability Issues  
- Several hundred methods exhibit high cyclomatic complexity (some > 45), making them difficult to maintain and test.  
- Large, monolithic classes with duplicated code (~8% duplication) increase technical debt and migration risk.

### 5. Illegal Reflective Access and Module System Conflicts  
- Reflection is used extensively on non-exported internal packages, triggering warnings and errors under Java 21.  
- Lack of modularization complicates compliance with Javaâ€™s module system, requiring architectural changes.

### 6. Deprecated API Usage  
- Presence of deprecated threading APIs (e.g., `Thread.stop()`) that are removed or unsafe in Java 21.  
- Use of such APIs risks unstable behavior and must be refactored.

### 7. Security Concerns  
- Unsafe memory operations via internal APIs create memory safety vulnerabilities.  
- Reflection without validation raises injection and manipulation risks, necessitating code audit.

## Effort Estimate & Technical Debt

- Approximately 120,000 lines of Java code spread over ~3000 files.  
- Estimated remediation time: **~150 developer days**, primarily for refactoring, dependency upgrades, and testing.  
- Current test coverage is moderate (~65% unit tests, ~40% integration tests), requiring expansion for safe migration.

## Recommendations & Next Steps

### Phase 1: Dependency Upgrades & Compatibility Fixes  
- Upgrade Spring Boot to version 3.x and Spring Framework to 6.x to support Java 21 and Jakarta EE 9 namespaces.  
- Add explicit Maven/Gradle dependencies for removed Java EE modules (JAXB, JAX-WS).  
- Audit and upgrade all third-party libraries to Java 21 compatible versions.  
- Use JVM flags (`--add-opens`) sparingly as a temporary measure only.

### Phase 2: Code Refactoring & Modularization  
- Replace all internal JDK API usages with standard supported APIs or reliable third-party libraries (e.g., VarHandle, java.lang.invoke).  
- Refactor high-complexity methods into smaller, maintainable units following best practices.  
- Modularize the codebase to align with Java 21 module system and reduce illegal reflective access issues.  
- Consolidate duplicated utility code applying DRY principles to reduce maintenance overhead.

### Phase 3: Legacy API Removal & Modernization  
- Remove deprecated threading APIs and adopt modern concurrency mechanisms from `java.util.concurrent`.  
- Migrate Java EE namespace usages from `javax.*` to `jakarta.*`.  
- Audit and enhance null safety, security validations, and exception handling to reduce runtime failures.

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation  
- Extend unit and integration test coverage, focusing on critical and legacy code paths to catch regressions.  
- Employ static analysis tools (`jdeps`, `jdeprscan`) during migration to monitor internal API usage.  
- Execute thorough integration testing to confirm compatibility and runtime stability.

## Conclusion

The kitchensink migration from Java 10 to Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.x is a complex but achievable modernization endeavor. The primary challenges stem from outdated API usages, heavy dependence on internal JDK mechanisms, and monolithic code structures.

Successfully addressing these challenges through a phased, structured approach will ensure the application:

- Remains stable and maintainable in the long term.  
- Leverages modern Java and Spring Boot platform capabilities.  
- Mitigates security and runtime risks inherent in legacy code.

Timely attention to dependency upgrades, code refactoring, and comprehensive testing will minimize risk and facilitate a smooth transition to the modern Java ecosystem.
