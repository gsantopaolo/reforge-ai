Identification of Least-Coupled Module and Domain-driven Boundaries\n\n- After coupling analysis and DDD consideration, the **`util` package** is identified as the least coupled module suitable for first migration.\n- It contains essential helper utilities (`Resources.java`), with limited dependencies on other modules.\n- This package forms foundational support for other modules and can be migrated independently with low risk.\n\n## 2. Spring Modulith as Intermediate Modular Monolith Step\n\n- Spring Modulith provides conventions/APIs for defining logical **modules inside a Spring Boot monolith**.\n- Use Spring Modulith to **introduce module boundaries incrementally** before splitting into microservices.\n- Encapsulate `util` package as a Spring Modulith module implementing shared utilities.\n- Benefits:\n  - Enforces **module isolation and dependency rules**.\n  - Supports **transaction management, events, and API encapsulation**.\n  - Facilitates later decomposition into microservices.\n\n## 3. Coexistence Strategy: Legacy + New Modules\n\n- Use an **API Gateway or Proxy** (e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway or Zuul) for **routing requests between legacy and new modules**.\n- Implement **Branch-by-Abstraction**: create interface layers abstracting calls to either legacy or new components.\n- Monitor traffic with routing rules and **gradually switch client calls** to Spring Boot modules.\n- Ensure both legacy and migrated modules can **run in parallel** during transition.\n  \n## 4. OpenRewrite and Modern Build/Config Enhancements\n\n- Leverage **OpenRewrite recipes** specifically tailored for:\n  - Migrating Jakarta EE namespaces to Spring Boot 3.2+ compatible APIs.\n  - Refactoring `EntityManager` to Spring Data repositories.\n  - Updating validation and CDI annotations to Spring equivalents.\n- Automate build and config file migration (e.g., `pom.xml`, `application.properties` to Spring Boot starters).\n- Use OpenRewrite as part of daily or sprint-based CI tasks to **enforce migration quality gates**.\n\n## 5. Adoption of Virtual Threads in High-Throughput Components\n\n- Identify components in `service` and `rest` modules that perform **blocking I/O or high concurrency tasks**.\n- Plan **incremental replacement with virtual threads** by:\n  - Using Java 21 Project Loom capabilities.\n  - Gradually migrate request handler threads, database calls, and service orchestration code to **virtual threads**.\n- Test extensively with Spring\u2019s **reactive programming support** for compatibility.\n  \n## 6. Strangler Fig and Incremental Migration Principles\n\n- Implement Strangler Fig pattern by:\n  - Extracting modules incrementally.\n  - Using feature toggles or API gateway routing to route traffic.\n  - Avoiding big-bang migration; apply **phased co-existence strategies** instead.\n  \n---\n\n# Migration Plan \u2014 YAML Format\n\n```yaml\nphases:\n  - id: 1\n    description: Extract and migrate `util` package as standalone Spring Modulith module with Java 21 features.\n    output: Spring Boot Java 21 compatible `util` module with module boundaries, injected via Spring DI.\n    suggested_tools:\n      - KnowledgeBaseTool\n      - DomainModelAnalyzerTool\n      - OpenRewriteTool\n      - CompilerTool\n      - TestRunnerTool\n      - DocumentationTool\n\n  - id: 2\n    description: Incrementally migrate `data` and `service` packages refactoring to Spring Data JPA repositories and Spring @Service beans.\n    output: Modularized data and service layers supporting both legacy and Spring Boot coexistence.\n    suggested_tools:\n      - OpenRewriteTool\n      - DomainModelAnalyzerTool\n      - CodeLoaderTool\n      - CompilerTool\n      - TestRunnerTool\n      - DocumentationTool\n\n  - id: 3\n    description: Migrate controller and rest packages to Spring MVC and Spring Boot REST controllers, integrating with API Gateway.\n    output: Fully modularized Spring Boot REST API with routing configured for legacy coexistence.\n    suggested_tools:\n      - GatewayConfiguratorTool\n      - OpenRewriteTool\n      - CompilerTool\n      - TestRunnerTool\n      - DocumentationTool\n\n  - id: 4\n    description: Integrate virtual threads in high-throughput components, conduct performance and correctness testing.\n    output: Optimized Spring Boot modules leveraging Java 21 virtual threads.\n    suggested_tools:\n      - CompilerTool\n      - TestRunnerTool\n      - KnowledgeBaseTool\n\n  - id: 5\n    description: Complete legacy system deprecation, consolidate codebase, optimize modularity for production microservices deployment.\n    output: Fully modernized Java 21 Spring Boot application with modular microservices-ready architecture.\n    suggested_tools:\n      - KnowledgeBaseTool\n      - DiagramGeneratorTool\n      - DocumentationTool\n\n---\n\n# Detailed Agent Actions for Migration of `util` Module (Phase 1)\n\n- Identify all files in `util` package, e.g., `Resources.java`.\n- Refactor code using OpenRewrite Spring Boot 3.2 recipes to modernize annotations, logging, and dependencies.\n- Break down `util` package into a Spring Modulith module, creating module descriptor using Spring Modulith APIs.\n- Migrate codebase to Java 21 language features (e.g., Records, Pattern Matching, Sealed Classes) as appropriate.\n- Add tests verifying functionality.\n- Package and build as standalone jar/library to be referenced by other modules.\n- Commit changes incrementally to central knowledge base documenting migration artifacts and issues.\n\n---\n\n# Coexistence Strategy to Enable Parallel Legacy and New Modules\n\n- Establish API Gateway routing rules:\n  - Route relevant REST paths to new Spring Boot modules.\n  - Route remaining legacy functionality unchanged.\n- Implement Branch-by-Abstraction via interfaces abstracting services that route to legacy or new services based on feature flags.\n- Use proxy components to translate calls between legacy EJB and Spring Beans where needed.\n- Continuously sync database schemas with Flyway to maintain compatibility.\n- Monitor and log traffic flows for safe rollbacks or rapid fixes.\n- Gradually increase traffic share to migrated modules controlled by rollout plans.\n\n---\n\n# Dependency Minimization Strategies\n\n- Refactor service and data layers to use Spring Data repositories instead of tightly coupled EntityManager.\n- Introduce API boundaries between modules using Spring Modulith.\n- Avoid circular dependencies by enforcing module visibility rules.\n- Leverage Dependency Injection for loose coupling.\n- Use branch-by-abstraction to isolate legacy from new code during phased migration.\n\n---\n\n# List of Modules and Components to Migrate from Least to More Complex (Including Classes)\n\n1. util  \n   - Resources.java\n\n2. model  \n   - Member.java  (Enhanced with Java 21 features)\n\n3. data  \n   - MemberRepository.java (Migrate to Spring Data JPA Repository Interface)  \n   - MemberListProducer.java (Spring Bean producer service)\n\n4. service  \n   - MemberRegistration.java (Convert to Spring @Service with @Transactional)\n\n5. controller  \n   - MemberController.java (Convert to Spring MVC Controller)\n\n6. rest  \n   - JaxRsActivator.java (Replace with Spring Boot auto configuration)  \n   - MemberResourceRESTService.java (Spring REST @RestController)\n\n---\n\nThis comprehensive plan harnesses modern Java 21 and Spring Boot best practices, strongly aligning with domain-driven design, modular monolith preparations with Spring Modulith, gateway routing for backward compatibility, OpenRewrite automation for safe migration, and progressive virtual thread adoption for performance gains.
