Phased Extraction Plan for MemberListProducer Module Modernization to Java 21 and Spring Boot

---

**1. Selection Criteria for Module Extraction:**

- Minimal inbound and outbound dependencies to reduce impact on legacy.
- Standalone functionality that can be built, tested, and deployed independently.
- Clear interface contracts for consuming legacy components.
- Low coupling and high cohesion.
- Smaller codebase size for faster iteration and testing.

MemberListProducer meets these criteria: it is a data provider with minimal dependencies and no service or controller dependencies.

---

**2. Extraction Plan Steps:**

**Phase 1: Preparation and Setup**

- Deliverables:
  - Identification of interface contracts used by MemberListProducer.
  - Fork or branch for modular extraction development.
  - Setup Spring Boot 3.x project with Java 21 compatibility.
  - Define Maven/Gradle multi-module build if applicable.
- Activities:
  - Isolate MemberListProducer class from legacy codebase.
  - Define APIs for data production (methods, return types).
  - Setup automated tests covering existing functionalities.
  - Establish baseline CI/CD pipeline with quality gates.

**Phase 2: Module Refactoring and Re-implementation**

- Deliverables:
  - MemberListProducer implemented as a Spring Bean within Spring Boot.
  - Unit and integration tests ported or rewritten with Spring Boot testing framework.
  - Dependency injection replacing CDI producers.
- Activities:
  - Migrate persistence context injection to Spring Data JPA or configured EntityManagerFactory.
  - Refactor configuration for resources, e.g., database connections.
  - Adjust logging to SLF4J abstraction with Logback.
  - Validate using test coverage and integration tests.

**Phase 3: Integration with Legacy Code**

- Deliverables:
  - Interoperability layer or adapter allowing legacy modules to consume the new MemberListProducer bean.
  - Documentation for consumers on new APIs and usage.
  - Strategies for backward compatibility such as facade classes or dual servicing.
- Activities:
  - Expose MemberListProducer as service accessible via REST or messaging if needed.
  - Implement adapter classes in legacy code to redirect calls.
  - Perform integration testing covering legacy-to-new invocation.
  - Monitor runtime for errors and performance impact.

**Phase 4: Deployment and Monitoring**

- Deliverables:
  - Deployment of MemberListProducer module independently.
  - Monitoring dashboards and logs for runtime behavior.
  - Feedback loop for iterative improvement.
- Activities:
  - Deploy to test/staging environment alongside legacy.
  - Gradually shift traffic or update dependencies to use new module.
  - Audit logs and metrics for errors, dependency issues, and latency.
  - Perform rollback plan if issues arise.

**Phase 5: Completion and Clean-up**

- Deliverables:
  - Removal or refactoring of legacy MemberListProducer.
  - Updated documentation and maintenance guidelines.
- Activities:
  - Remove legacy module code after rollout success.
  - Refactor dependent legacy code to rely solely on new implementation.
  - Final audit and knowledge base update.

**3. Dependency Minimization Strategies:**

- Use interfaces or abstraction layers to encapsulate functionality and isolate legacy dependencies.
- Implement clear input/output contracts with DTOs or API DTO models instead of passing domain entities directly.
- Inject dependencies via Spring DI framework, replacing CDI.
- Avoid direct legacy code calls inside new module; use event-driven communication or well-defined adapters.
- Gradually refactor legacy code to consume new module APIs without simultaneous large code rewrites.
- Maintain backward compatibility during migration via facade adapters or dual implementations.
- Automate testing and use quality gates for consistent standards and early defect detection.

This phased plan ensures incremental safe extraction of the least-coupled module (MemberListProducer) to modern Java 21 and Spring Boot, with minimal disruption to legacy systems and clear dependency management to enable coexistence.
