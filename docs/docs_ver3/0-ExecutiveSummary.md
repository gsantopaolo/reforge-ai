Kitchensink Project Modernization Roadmap to Spring Boot on Java 21

---

Executive Summary:

This comprehensive modernization roadmap for the Kitchensink project orchestrates the phased migration from legacy Jakarta EE / Red Hat JBoss EAP architecture to a modern Spring Boot application running on Java 21. The plan prioritizes low-coupling, high-value modules first, sequences migration activities to reduce risk, and integrates human review checkpoints to maintain quality and governance. It balances technical refactoring, tooling adoption, and risk mitigation to ensure seamless transformation.

1. Prioritization of Modules by Business Value and Coupling

| Priority | Module Package                          | Description / Rationale                        |
|----------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1        | org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.util (`Resources` class) | Least coupled utility module; minimal dependencies; ideal to start for low-risk migration and establishing new infrastructure (logging, DI, CI/CD). |
| 2        | org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.model (`Member` entity) | Core domain entity; foundation for data and service layers; must be modernized early for compatibility. |
| 3        | org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.data (`MemberRepository`, `MemberListProducer`) | Data access layer, directly dependent on model; migration pivotal for persistence modernization. |
| 4        | org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.service (`MemberRegistration`) | Business logic module relying on model; critical for smooth service operation post-migration. |
| 5        | org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.controller (`MemberController`) | Manages UI logic; depends on service and model; can be migrated after service stabilization. |
| 6        | org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.rest (`JaxRsActivator`, `MemberResourceRESTService`) | REST API layer; highest coupling and complexity due to external interface; migrate last to minimize breakage risk. |

2. Grouping Changes into Phases with Deliverables and Review Checkpoints

| Phase | Scope                                            | Key Activities and Deliverables                                                                                                                                    | Review Checkpoints / Quality Gates                           |

4. Dependencies and Integration Considerations

- Dependency chain follows module interactions as:
  util (isolated) → model → data → service → controller → rest
- Each successive phase depends on successful completion of previous module migrations.
- Coexistence strategies employ:
  - Conditional module loading,
  - Injection bridges between legacy and Spring Boot components,
  - Incremental testing and deployment cycles to mitigate regression risks.
- Legacy codebases remain operational side-by-side with migrated modules until full cutover.

5. Risk Register with Severity Levels and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk ID | Description                                                    | Affected Module(s)               | Severity | Mitigation                                                                                                           |

6. Migration Best Practices and Recommended Tooling

- Adopt phased migration employing the **Strangler Fig Pattern** to incrementally replace functionalities.
- Use **Branch-by-Abstraction** for isolating legacy calls and enabling smooth switchovers.
- Apply **Anti-Corruption Layers** to segregate legacy and new systems reducing dependency risks.
- Use **Eclipse Transformer** for automated package namespace replacement (javax → jakarta).
- Employ **OpenRewrite** for recipe-driven automated refactoring of legacy APIs and patterns.
- Leverage **Spring Boot Migrator (SBM)** to automate and accelerate configuration and adaptation to Spring Boot.
- Replace legacy logging with **SLF4J + Logback** in all modules.
- Migrate persistence to **Spring Data JPA with Hibernate ORM 6+** for full Java 21 compatibility.
- Replace **JAX-RS REST services** with Spring MVC `@RestController`.
- Replace **JSF UI** with Spring MVC and Thymeleaf templates or modern JavaScript frontends.
- Upgrade testing frameworks from **JUnit 4 to JUnit 5**, adopt **Spring Boot Test** framework for integration tests.
- Maintain a detailed **central knowledge base** documenting migration decisions, best practices, and decision rationale.
- Schedule **weekly documentation and code review sprints** with strict quality gate audits.
- Conduct continuous **performance and integration testing** after each migration phase.

7. Summary of Phased Extraction for Util.Resources (Phase 1 Detailed)

- Migrate `Resources.java` as an isolated Spring Boot module using SLF4J logging.
- Ensure the module is consumable by legacy and new modules during coexistence.
- Deliver unit tests validating logging behavior.
- Integrate Spring DI annotations for dependency management.
- Use CI/CD pipelines for build, test, and deployment automation.
- This phase sets the foundation for subsequent module migrations with tooling and infrastructure in place.

---

8. Governance and Coordination

- Maintain roadmap visibility with all stakeholders via executive reports.
- Schedule human review checkpoints post each phase to verify adherence to quality and schedule.
- Enforce coding standards, migration practices, and documentation completeness via governance frameworks.
- Monitor risks continuously and update mitigation strategies as necessary.
