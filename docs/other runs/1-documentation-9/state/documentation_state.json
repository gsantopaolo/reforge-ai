Classes like `MemberRepository` provide methods to query members by ID or email, while `MemberListProducer` manages producing collections of members, supporting the service layer.\n\nBusiness logic resides in the `service` package, notably the `MemberRegistration` class, which orchestrates registering new members by utilizing the data repository and enforcing domain rules.\n\nThe `controller` package includes UI-facing classes like `MemberController` which manage user interactions and invoke the service layer to perform operations on members, handling errors and validation.\n\nRESTful API exposure is handled by the `rest` package. The `JaxRsActivator` initializes REST resources, while `MemberResourceRESTService` implements REST endpoints, mapping HTTP requests to service methods for CRUD operations on members.\n\nFinally, utility functionalities, such as logging provided by the `Resources` class in the `util` package, support other modules.\n\nInteractions flow from REST and controller layers invoking service operations which themselves query and update data repositories, maintaining clean separation and modularity for ease of maintenance and expansion.",

      "raw": "Migration Practices Report for Migrating Java EE / Red Hat JBoss EAP to Spring Boot on Java 21 and Legacy Framework Modernization\n\n1. Migration Patterns\n\n- Strangler Fig Pattern:\n  The Strangler Fig pattern is recommended for incrementally migrating a monolithic Java EE application to microservices or modular Spring Boot components. It involves gradually replacing parts of the legacy system by routing functionality either to the new system or retaining it in the legacy one until full migration is complete. This pattern reduces risk by allowing co-existence and phased rollout of components.\n\n- Branch-by-Abstraction:\n  This strategy uses an abstraction layer that both legacy and new implementations conform to, allowing seamless switching between legacy and modernized code paths. It supports parallel development and straightforward fallbacks and is suitable for refactoring legacy frameworks such as persistence, logging, and validation.\n\n2. Tool Recommendations\n\n- OpenRewrite:\n  OpenRewrite provides automated source code refactoring recipes designed to upgrade and migrate Java applications. It has specific recipes for migrating to Spring Boot 3.0, adjusting deprecated API usage, and updating configurations. Utilizing OpenRewrite accelerates bulk code modifications and reduces errors in migration.\n\n- jdeps:\n  The Java dependency analysis tool jdeps helps identify dependencies and transitive libraries in current applications, critical for preparing migration by assessing compatibility and dependency footprint on Java 21 and Spring Boot stacks.\n\n- Flyway and Liquibase:\n  For database migrations, Flyway and Liquibase are robust tools to manage schema versioning and data transformations in a controlled, repeatable manner. They integrate well with Spring Boot and facilitate evolving the database schema alongside application refactoring.\n\n3. Legacy Framework Modernization\n\n- Logging:\n  Migrate from legacy Java logging frameworks (e.g., java.util.logging, Log4j 1.x) to SLF4J with Logback or Log4j2 supported by Spring Boot starters, standardizing logging and making configuration simpler.\n\n- Persistence:\n  Transition from JPA EntityManager and Hibernate setups in Java EE to Spring Data JPA repositories, leveraging repository abstractions for cleaner code. Employ Flyway/Liquibase to version database schema migrations.\n\n- Validation:\n  Replace legacy bean validation with Spring Boot's integrated validation starter using Hibernate Validator, enabling robust and declarative validation mechanisms.\n\n4. Case-Study References and Insights\n\n- Red Hat's Migration Toolkit for Runtimes (MTR) provides insights into automating migration assessments and categorizing remediation steps. Although primarily targeting Red Hat environments, MTR principles apply broadly for modernizing Java apps.\n\n- Community reports on migrating large-scale payments systems show success with the Strangler Fig pattern by incrementally replacing parts with Spring Boot microservices while continuing to route older logic.\n\n- OpenRewrite users report significant reduction in manual changes when upgrading core dependencies, API versions, and migrating to Spring Boot 3 ecosystem leveraging OpenRewrite's codemod recipes.\n\n- Flyway/Liquibase case studies highlight seamless database evolution management supporting continuous integration pipelines during refactoring.\n\nConclusion: Adopt phased migration strategies like the Strangler Fig Pattern and branch-by-abstraction to incrementally modernize Java EE / JBoss EAP applications. Utilize automated tooling such as OpenRewrite for codebase refactoring and jdeps for dependency analysis. Manage database evolution with Flyway or Liquibase integrated into Spring Boot. Modernize legacy frameworks stepwise to Spring Boot equivalents for logging, persistence, and validation. Leverage documented migration guides and case studies from Red Hat and community sources to tailor migration plans suited for Java 21 environments.\n\nReferences:\n- https://docs.openrewrite.org/\n- https://medium.com/@rrbadam/strangler-fig-pattern-to-migrate-from-a-monolithic-java-application-to-spring-boot-microservices-1f260bb6e4c4\n- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.0-Migration-Guide\n- https://flywaydb.org/documentation/\n- https://www.liquibase.org/get-started/migration-tutorial\n- https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/migration_toolkit_for_runtimes/1.2/html-single/introduction_to_the_migration_toolkit_for_runtimes/index",

      "raw": "# kitchensink Java 21 & Spring Boot Migration - Phased Extraction Plan\n\n---\n\n## 1. Identification of Least-Coupled Module and Domain-driven Boundaries\n\n- After coupling analysis and DDD consideration, the **`util` package** is identified as the least coupled module suitable for first migration.\n- It contains essential helper utilities (`Resources.java`), with limited dependencies on other modules.\n- This package forms foundational support for other modules and can be migrated independently with low risk.\n\n## 2. Spring Modulith as Intermediate Modular Monolith Step\n\n- Spring Modulith provides conventions/APIs for defining logical **modules inside a Spring Boot monolith**.\n- Use Spring Modulith to **introduce module boundaries incrementally** before splitting into microservices.\n- Encapsulate `util` package as a Spring Modulith module implementing shared utilities.\n- Benefits:\n  - Enforces **module isolation and dependency rules**.\n  - Supports **transaction management, events, and API encapsulation**.\n  - Facilitates later decomposition into microservices.\n\n## 3. Coexistence Strategy: Legacy + New Modules\n\n- Use an **API Gateway or Proxy** (e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway or Zuul) for **routing requests between legacy and new modules**.\n- Implement **Branch-by-Abstraction**: create interface layers abstracting calls to either legacy or new components.\n- Monitor traffic with routing rules and **gradually switch client calls** to Spring Boot modules.\n- Ensure both legacy and migrated modules can **run in parallel** during transition.\n  \n## 4. OpenRewrite and Modern Build/Config Enhancements\n\n- Leverage **OpenRewrite recipes** specifically tailored for:\n  - Migrating Jakarta EE namespaces to Spring Boot 3.2+ compatible APIs.\n  - Refactoring `EntityManager` to Spring Data repositories.\n  - Updating validation and CDI annotations to Spring equivalents.\n- Automate build and config file migration (e.g., `pom.xml`, `application.properties` to Spring Boot starters).\n- Use OpenRewrite as part of daily or sprint-based CI tasks to **enforce migration quality gates**.\n\n## 5. Adoption of Virtual Threads in High-Throughput Components\n\n- Identify components in `service` and `rest` modules that perform **blocking I/O or high concurrency tasks**.\n- Plan **incremental replacement with virtual threads** by:\n  - Using Java 21 Project Loom capabilities.\n  - Gradually migrate request handler threads, database calls, and service orchestration code to **virtual threads**.\n- Test extensively with Spring\u2019s **reactive programming support** for compatibility.\n  \n## 6. Strangler Fig and Incremental Migration Principles\n\n- Implement Strangler Fig pattern by:\n  - Extracting modules incrementally.\n  - Using feature toggles or API gateway routing to route traffic.\n  - Avoiding big-bang migration; apply **phased co-existence strategies** instead.\n  \n---\n\n# Migration Plan \u2014 YAML Format\n\n```yaml\nphases:\n  - id: 1\n    description: Extract and migrate `util` package as standalone Spring Modulith module with Java 21 features.\n    output: Spring Boot Java 21 compatible `util` module with module boundaries, injected via Spring DI.\n    suggested_tools:\n      - KnowledgeBaseTool\n      - DomainModelAnalyzerTool\n      - OpenRewriteTool\n      - CompilerTool\n      - TestRunnerTool\n      - DocumentationTool\n\n  - id: 2\n    description: Incrementally migrate `data` and `service` packages refactoring to Spring Data JPA repositories and Spring @Service beans.\n    output: Modularized data and service layers supporting both legacy and Spring Boot coexistence.\n    suggested_tools:\n      - OpenRewriteTool\n      - DomainModelAnalyzerTool\n      - CodeLoaderTool\n      - CompilerTool\n      - TestRunnerTool\n      - DocumentationTool\n\n  - id: 3\n    description: Migrate controller and rest packages to Spring MVC and Spring Boot REST controllers, integrating with API Gateway.\n    output: Fully modularized Spring Boot REST API with routing configured for legacy coexistence.\n    suggested_tools:\n      - GatewayConfiguratorTool\n      - OpenRewriteTool\n      - CompilerTool\n      - TestRunnerTool\n      - DocumentationTool\n\n  - id: 4\n    description: Integrate virtual threads in high-throughput components, conduct performance and correctness testing.\n    output: Optimized Spring Boot modules leveraging Java 21 virtual threads.\n    suggested_tools:\n      - CompilerTool\n      - TestRunnerTool\n      - KnowledgeBaseTool\n\n  - id: 5\n    description: Complete legacy system deprecation, consolidate codebase, optimize modularity for production microservices deployment.\n    output: Fully modernized Java 21 Spring Boot application with modular microservices-ready architecture.\n    suggested_tools:\n      - KnowledgeBaseTool\n      - DiagramGeneratorTool\n      - DocumentationTool\n\n---\n\n# Detailed Agent Actions for Migration of `util` Module (Phase 1)\n\n- Identify all files in `util` package, e.g., `Resources.java`.\n- Refactor code using OpenRewrite Spring Boot 3.2 recipes to modernize annotations, logging, and dependencies.\n- Break down `util` package into a Spring Modulith module, creating module descriptor using Spring Modulith APIs.\n- Migrate codebase to Java 21 language features (e.g., Records, Pattern Matching, Sealed Classes) as appropriate.\n- Add tests verifying functionality.\n- Package and build as standalone jar/library to be referenced by other modules.\n- Commit changes incrementally to central knowledge base documenting migration artifacts and issues.\n\n---\n\n# Coexistence Strategy to Enable Parallel Legacy and New Modules\n\n- Establish API Gateway routing rules:\n  - Route relevant REST paths to new Spring Boot modules.\n  - Route remaining legacy functionality unchanged.\n- Implement Branch-by-Abstraction via interfaces abstracting services that route to legacy or new services based on feature flags.\n- Use proxy components to translate calls between legacy EJB and Spring Beans where needed.\n- Continuously sync database schemas with Flyway to maintain compatibility.\n- Monitor and log traffic flows for safe rollbacks or rapid fixes.\n- Gradually increase traffic share to migrated modules controlled by rollout plans.\n\n---\n\n# Dependency Minimization Strategies\n\n- Refactor service and data layers to use Spring Data repositories instead of tightly coupled EntityManager.\n- Introduce API boundaries between modules using Spring Modulith.\n- Avoid circular dependencies by enforcing module visibility rules.\n- Leverage Dependency Injection for loose coupling.\n- Use branch-by-abstraction to isolate legacy from new code during phased migration.\n\n---\n\n# List of Modules and Components to Migrate from Least to More Complex (Including Classes)\n\n1. util  \n   - Resources.java\n\n2. model  \n   - Member.java  (Enhanced with Java 21 features)\n\n3. data  \n   - MemberRepository.java (Migrate to Spring Data JPA Repository Interface)  \n   - MemberListProducer.java (Spring Bean producer service)\n\n4. service  \n   - MemberRegistration.java (Convert to Spring @Service with @Transactional)\n\n5. controller  \n   - MemberController.java (Convert to Spring MVC Controller)\n\n6. rest  \n   - JaxRsActivator.java (Replace with Spring Boot auto configuration)  \n   - MemberResourceRESTService.java (Spring REST @RestController)\n\n---\n\nThis comprehensive plan harnesses modern Java 21 and Spring Boot best practices, strongly aligning with domain-driven design, modular monolith preparations with Spring Modulith, gateway routing for backward compatibility, OpenRewrite automation for safe migration, and progressive virtual thread adoption for performance gains.
