  "raw": "Modernization Summary Report\n=============================\n\nPrepared by: Project Management Office  \nDate: [Insert Date]  \nVersion: 1.0\n\n---\n\nExecutive Overview\n-------------------\n\nThis report summarizes the progress and status of the ongoing system modernization initiative. The project is structured into six well-defined phases targeting upgrade and refactor of legacy dependencies, modernization of testing frameworks, runtime optimizations, and overall system enhancement to ensure compliance with Jakarta EE 9 standards and Java 11+ environments. Our goal is to transition to a maintainable, performant, and scalable architecture with minimal disruption.\n\n---\n\nCompleted Phases and Status\n----------------------------\n\n**Phase 1: Dependency and Namespace Upgrade**  \n- Status: In progress with substantial progress made on updating from `javax` to `jakarta` namespaces.  \n- Major libraries such as `hibernate-validator` are scheduled for upgrade to versions compatible with Java 11 and Jakarta EE 9.  \n- Legacy `javax` API usages identified and under systematic refactor.  \n- Deprecation issues with APIs highlighted in Migration Incidents (e.g., API_DEPRECATION_01).  \n- Mitigations include automated static code analysis and feature branch strategy to reduce risk.\n\n**Phase 2: Testing Framework Modernization**  \n- Status: Planning and evaluation stage.  \n- Identified critical blockers with current testing tools such as `arquillian-junit-container` that do not support Jakarta EE 9 or Java 11+.  \n- Resolution strategy includes upgrading Arquillian to new versions or migrating to modern frameworks such as JUnit 5 or TestNG.  \n- Risk mitigated by running parallel test suites and staged rollout.\n\n**Phase 3: JVM Flags and Startup Configuration**  \n- Status: In progress.  \n- Legacy JVM flags such as `-XX:+UseSplitVerifier` have been removed or are actively being replaced to align to Java 11+ runtime requirements.  \n- Validation in staging environments is ongoing.\n\n**Phases 4-6: Logging Upgrade, Date/Time API Migration, and CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements**  \n- Status: Scheduled in roadmap timeline; preparatory documentation and impact analysis underway.\n\n---\n\nRisk Mitigation Highlights\n---------------------------\n\n- Comprehensive impact analysis conducted prior to commencement of each phase reduces unforeseen disruptions.  \n- Legacy compatibility is maintained during phased refactors, with fallback branches ready for immediate rollback.  \n- Parallel test suite execution during testing modernization reduces risk of regression.  \n- Staged deployment in non-production environments for runtime configuration changes.  \n- Continuous monitoring for incidents and alerts through logging enhancements and detailed migration incidents logging.  \n- Close coordination between module owners and teams facilitated by detailed documentation in `/modules/README.md` and incident logging in `/migration-incidents/README.md`.\n\n---\n\nPerformance Improvements\n-------------------------\n\n- Upgrading to Jakarta EE 9 and Java 11+ facilitates use of modern, optimized APIs contributing to improved runtime efficiency.  \n- Removal of deprecated JVM flags eliminates potential startup performance penalties and increases runtime stability.  \n- Modernized testing frameworks enable quicker feedback cycles and more reliable test coverage, accelerating deployment velocity.  \n- Planned refactoring towards new Java Date/Time APIs improves maintainability and precision in time-sensitive operations.  \n- CI/CD pipeline enhancements post modernization will automate builds, tests, and deployments, improving overall delivery lifecycle speed and consistency.\n\n---\n\nAdditional Notes\n------------------\n\n- Migration incidents such as legacy API usages and library upgrade blockers are being tracked meticulously.  \n- Documentation scaffolding is established under `/knowledge-base` to ensure ongoing updates and knowledge sharing, including runbooks for operational procedures.  \n- Team commitment to phased approach ensures manageable scope and controlled risk exposure.\n\n---\n\nConclusion\n-----------\n\nThe modernization effort is advancing steadily with key foundational phases either completed or in progress. Risk mitigations are actively applied, and performance gains are anticipated as library and runtime upgrades take full effect. With structured planning and close stakeholder coordination, the project is on track to deliver a compliant, maintainable, and robust modern system architecture.\n\nWe recommend continued focus on completing phases per the roadmap timelines, completion of testing framework modernization, and execution of runbooks for operational readiness to ensure smooth transition.\n\nPrepared by: Project Management Office  \nDate: [Insert Date]  \nVersion: 1.0",
