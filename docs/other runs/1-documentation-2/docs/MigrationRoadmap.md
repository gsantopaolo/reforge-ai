# Migration Roadmap for System Modernization

## Introduction
This Migration Roadmap document outlines the phasing, prioritization, dependencies, and risk mitigation strategies for the ongoing system modernization effort. The goal is to transition the legacy system to a modern, maintainable, and compliant architecture aligned to Jakarta EE 9 standards and Java 11+ requirements while minimizing disruption.

| 2     | Testing Framework Modernization  | Replace/upgrade testing frameworks to support Jakarta EE 9 and newer versions of Java (e.g., upgrade Arquillian or switch to JUnit 5/TestNG). | High     | Completion of phase 1; testing dependency updates  | Maintain fallback to current test suites; parallel run of new framework tests.           | 3 weeks            |
| 3     | JVM Flags and Startup Configuration | Remove deprecated JVM flags (e.g. `-XX:+UseSplitVerifier`), update JVM startup parameters for Java 11+. | Medium   | Phase 1 completion for compatibility       | Validate in staging environments; rollback plan for startup failures.                  | 1 week             |
| 4     | Logging Upgrade                 | Refactor logging mechanisms if necessary to align with updated frameworks and standards.       | Medium   | Phase 1 and Phase 3                         | Maintain backward compatibility for logs; phased rollout per module.                  | 2 weeks            |
| 5     | Date/Time API Migration        | Refactor date/time handling code to use new Java Date/Time APIs introduced post-Java 8 where applicable. | Low      | Phase 1 and ongoing code cleanup            | Monitor for date/time handling regressions; write extensive tests around date/time handling. | 3 weeks            |
| 6     | Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) Enhancements | Enhance and automate build, test, and deployment pipelines to reflect new dependencies and frameworks. | Low      | Successful completion of prior phases       | Incremental pipeline updates; maintain manual fallback steps.                           | 2 weeks            |

## Detailed Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Dependency and Namespace Upgrade
- **Objective:** Eliminate deprecated `javax` namespace usage, upgrade libraries such as `hibernate-validator` to versions compatible with Java 11 and Jakarta EE 9.
- **Tasks:**
  - Identify all places using `javax` APIs and refactor code to use `jakarta` equivalent.
  - Upgrade libraries and assess backward compatibility.
  - Resolve dependency conflicts.
- **Dependencies:** Module readiness; availability of compatible new library versions.
- **Risk Mitigation:**
  - Use automated static code analysis tools.
  - Setup feature branches and staged integration deployments.
  - Maintain fallback branches for quick rollback.
- **Deliverables:** Refactored codebase, updated dependency manifests.

---

### Phase 2: Testing Framework Modernization
- **Objective:** Address critical blockers from legacy testing tools (e.g., Arquillian JUnit container) that do not support new Jakarta EE APIs nor Java 11+.
- **Tasks:**
  - Evaluate and select new testing framework(s): upgrade Arquillian or migrate to TestNG/JUnit 5.
  - Refactor or rewrite tests as needed.
  - Validate test suite coverage and stability.
- **Dependencies:** Completion of Phase 1 to ensure compatibility.
- **Risk Mitigation:**
  - Parallel test suite execution during transition.
  - Use staged environments for full integration tests.
- **Deliverables:** Fully functional and updated test suites.

---

### Phase 3: JVM Flags and Startup Configuration
- **Objective:** Remove and replace deprecated JVM flags to align with Java 11+ runtime requirements.
- **Tasks:**
  - Locate legacy JVM flags (`-XX:+UseSplitVerifier`).
  - Remove deprecated flags from startup scripts and configurations.
  - Tune JVM flags for optimal Java 11+ performance.
- **Dependencies:** Post Phase 1.
- **Risk Mitigation:**
  - Validate changes in non-production environments.
  - Prepare rollback startup configuration scripts.
- **Deliverables:** Updated startup configuration documentation and scripts.

---

### Phase 4: Logging Upgrade
- **Objective:** Update or refactor logging infrastructure to be compatible with other modernization phases and possibly enhance observability.
- **Tasks:**
  - Audit current logging libraries.
  - Upgrade logging frameworks if necessary.
  - Refactor logging calls in the codebase.
- **Dependencies:** After phase 1 and 3, as dependency updates and JVM settings may impact logging.
- **Risk Mitigation:**
  - Implement backward-compatible logging adapters.
  - Monitor logs closely during rollout.
- **Deliverables:** Updated logging system and documentation.

---

### Phase 5: Date/Time API Migration
- **Objective:** Modernize date/time handling code by leveraging newer Java APIs (e.g., java.time.* packages) replacing legacy datetime APIs.
- **Tasks:**
  - Identify legacy date/time usages.
  - Refactor code to new Java 8+ date/time APIs.
  - Add/extend unit tests to cover edge cases.
- **Dependencies:** Stability from prior phases to avoid integration issues.
- **Risk Mitigation:**
  - Thorough testing with historical and boundary date/time values.
  - Staged incremental refactoring with module-level focus.
- **Deliverables:** Modern and consistent date/time API usage.

---

### Phase 6: CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements
- **Objective:** Improve automation pipelines to support new build, test, and deployment requirements post-modernization.
- **Tasks:**
  - Update build scripts to incorporate new dependency versions.
  - Integrate new or upgraded test frameworks.
  - Automate deployment validations.
- **Dependencies:** Prior phases must have completed to stabilize code and tests.
- **Risk Mitigation:**
  - Maintain fallback manual deployment processes.
  - Incremental pipeline upgrades with full rollback plans.
- **Deliverables:** Updated and reliable CI/CD pipelines.

## Dependencies and Notes
- Dependency upgrade in Phase 1 is critical and prerequisite for other phases.
- Testing modernization addresses a critical blocker for migration.
- JVM flags adjustment ensures runtime compatibility.
- All phases require coordination with module owners as listed in `/modules/README.md`.
- Incident resolution status should be updated in `/migration-incidents/README.md`.
- Detailed runbooks should be developed per phase steps and stored under `/runbooks/`.
