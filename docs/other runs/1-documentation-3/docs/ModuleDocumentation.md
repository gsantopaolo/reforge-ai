# architecture/README.md

# Architecture Overview

## System High-Level Architecture

The kitchensink system is a web application demonstrating JSF and REST integration with a layered architecture:

- Presentation Layer: MemberController handles frontend UI interactions via JSF.
- Business Layer: MemberRegistration performs validation and business rules for member management.
- Data Layer: MemberRepository and MemberListProducer manage persistence using JPA.
- REST Layer: MemberResourceRESTService provides RESTful API endpoints exposing member resources.
- Utility Layer: Resources provides supporting functions such as Logger producer.

## Key Design Principles

- Separation of concerns via layered architecture.
- Use of CDI for dependency injection.
- Stateless EJBs for business logic enabling scalability.
- RESTful services for system integration.
- Use of JPA entities and criteria queries for persistence abstraction.

## Architectural Diagrams

- [Placeholder] UML class diagrams showing relationships between controller, service, data, model, and rest packages.
- [Placeholder] Sequence diagrams of member registration flow from REST API or UI controller invoking service and data layers.

## Notes

- The system uses Jakarta EE standards including CDI, EJB, JPA, and JAX-RS.
- Validation occurs both in service and REST layers ensuring data integrity on multiple fronts.

# Dependencies

## Overview

The kitchensink project relies on Jakarta EE APIs and supporting libraries:

| Dependency                                      | Version                    | Purpose                     | Notes      |

| org.jboss.arquillian.protocol:arquillian-protocol-servlet-jakarta | 1.7.0.Final | Servlet protocol for tests   | test       |

## Update and Compatibility Notes

- Jakarta EE 9+ versions are used reflecting namespace changes.
- Hibernate ORM 6 migration accounted for by model metamodel generation.
- Testing frameworks include JUnit and Arquillian for integration testing.

# Migration Incidents

## Incident Log

| Date       | Module/Component           | Description                              | Resolution                  | Status     |
|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------|
| 2024-04-01 | MemberRegistration Service  | Deprecated API usage in persistence calls| Updated to JPA specification calls | Resolved  |
| 2024-04-15 | REST Service Validation     | Bean validation version conflict          | Aligned validator version | Resolved   |
| 2024-05-10 | Member Entity              | Field type mismatch in phoneNumber field  | Adjusted field definitions | Resolved   |

## Lessons Learned

- Ensure dependencies are aligned to compatible Jakarta EE versions early.
- Rigorous validation is essential at multiple layers.
- Decouple persistence logic from entity mutators for forward compatibility.

- Database Migration: Procedures for migrating the member database schema.
- Troubleshooting Registration Issues: Steps to debug and resolve member registration errors.

## Sample Runbook Template

### Title
Application Deployment on WildFly Server

### Preconditions
- WildFly server is installed and running.
- User has deployment privileges.

### Steps
1. Build the kitchensink WAR artifact using Maven.
2. Copy the WAR file to the WildFly deployments directory.
3. Confirm deployment logs show successful startup.
4. Access application URL to confirm operational status.

### Expected Results
- Application is accessible.
- No errors occur in server logs during startup.

### Rollback Procedures
- Remove the deployed WAR.
- Redeploy previous stable version.
- Monitor logs for issues.
