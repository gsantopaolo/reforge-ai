# Migration Roadmap for Kitchensink Modernization

## Overview
This Migration Roadmap outlines the modernization efforts for the Kitchensink project, divided into clear phases, prioritized according to impact, dependencies, and risk mitigation. It aims to provide a comprehensive plan for smooth migration aligned with project timeline, ensuring minimal disruption and maximized maintainability.

---

## Phases and Tasks

### Phase 1: Logging Infrastructure Upgrade
**Objective:** Modernize logging utilities to support standardized logging frameworks and enable better traceability.

- Refactor `util` module's Logger producer to use latest Jakarta EE logging or SLF4J.
- Audit usages of Logger injections across modules and unify approach.
- Validate logging works seamlessly with updated dependencies.

**Dependencies:**
- None; foundational phase.

**Risks and Mitigation:**
- Risk: Deprecated logger APIs could cause runtime issues.
- Mitigation: Unit test logging outputs and integration points early.

**Duration:** 2 weeks

---

### Phase 2: Date/Time and Entity Field Migrations
**Objective:** Migrate legacy date/time APIs and correct data field mismatches in entities.

- Refactor `model.Member` entity for consistent use of Jakarta Date/Time APIs.
- Fix field type mismatch issues like `phoneNumber` based on migration incidents.
- Adjust persistence annotations and converters as needed.

**Dependencies:**
- Completion of Phase 1 for logging visibility during debugging.
- Requires updated JPA dependency versions from Phase 3.

**Risks and Mitigation:**
- Risk: Data loss or corruption during schema migration.
- Mitigation: Create and test runbooks for database migration and rollback (refer to runbooks).

**Duration:** 3 weeks

---

### Phase 3: JPA Persistence Modernization
**Objective:** Align persistence layer with current JPA specifications and improve data layer robustness.

- Upgrade JPA usage in `data` module, refactor deprecated persistence calls.
- Verify and update metamodel generation (hibernate-jpamodelgen).
- Decouple persistence logic from entity mutators following best practices.

**Dependencies:**
- Phase 2 completion for consistent entity models.
- Dependency updates (Phase 6) should be coordinated.

**Risks and Mitigation:**
- Risk: Broken data access or changed behavior.
- Mitigation: Extensive integration and regression testing; monitor migration incident logs.

**Duration:** 4 weeks

---

### Phase 4: Bean Validation and REST Service Enhancement
**Objective:** Upgrade validation frameworks and improve REST API resilience.

- Resolve validator version conflicts in REST layer.
- Enhance validation logic in `rest` module endpoints.
- Improve error handling and API contract adherence.

**Dependencies:**
- Phase 3 to ensure data layer stability.
- Dependency upgrades (Phase 6) for aligned validator libraries.

**Risks and Mitigation:**
- Risk: API contract breaking changes impacting clients.
- Mitigation: Version API carefully; notify consumers of changes.

**Duration:** 3 weeks

---

### Phase 5: Dependency Upgrades and Compatibility Alignment
**Objective:** Update all major dependencies to compatible Jakarta EE 9+ versions.

- Update Jakarta EE dependencies including CDI, JPA, Activation API.
- Upgrade Hibernate ORM and Bean Validator to finalized versions.
- Validate compatibility and run full test suite.

**Dependencies:**
- Works in parallel with earlier phases but final verification post major refactorings.

**Risks and Mitigation:**
- Risk: Incompatibility and integration issues.
- Mitigation: Maintain a dependency matrix and use compatibility notes; roll back capability maintained.

**Duration:** 2 weeks

---

### Phase 6: Testing Framework Modernization
**Objective:** Update test frameworks for enhanced integration testing capabilities.

- Upgrade JUnit and Arquillian versions.
- Refactor test cases reflecting API and dependency changes.
- Automate regression tests in CI/CD.

**Dependencies:**
- Post Phase 5 dependency stabilizations.
- Ensures confidence across all prior phases.

**Risks and Mitigation:**
- Risk: Tests breaking causing delays.
- Mitigation: Incremental refactoring; perform test runs frequently.

**Duration:** 2 weeks

---

### Phase 7: Data Model Reconciliation and Final Clean-up
**Objective:** Final adjustments in data models, cleaning obsolete code, and ensuring documentation alignment.

- Revisit `model` and `service` modules for any residual issues.
- Ensure migration incidents are resolved and documented.
- Update knowledge base with migration runbooks and architectural notes.

**Dependencies:**
- Final phase after all migration steps.

**Risks and Mitigation:**
- Risk: Overlooked issues.
- Mitigation: Code reviews, audit logs, and knowledge base updates.

**Duration:** 2 weeks

## Dependencies and Scheduling Summary

| Phase | Name                          | Depends On       | Duration | Start Week | End Week |
|-------|-------------------------------|------------------|----------|------------|----------|
| 1     | Logging Infrastructure Upgrade | None             | 2 weeks  | 1          | 2        |
| 2     | Date/Time and Entity Field Migration | Phase 1         | 3 weeks  | 3          | 5        |
| 3     | JPA Persistence Modernization  | Phase 2          | 4 weeks  | 6          | 9        |
| 4     | Bean Validation & REST Enhancement | Phase 3          | 3 weeks  | 10         | 12       |
| 5     | Dependency Upgrades            | Parallel/Early & Final Verification | 2 weeks  | 6          | 7, Final verify post 12 |
| 6     | Testing Framework Modernization| Phase 5          | 2 weeks  | 13         | 14       |
| 7     | Data Model Reconciliation      | All prior phases | 2 weeks  | 15         | 16       |

*Note:* Dependency upgrades (Phase 5) start early in parallel with phase 3 but need final testing and verification after phase 4.

---

## Risk Mitigation Summary

- **Early Detection**: Address migration incidents early by referring to the Migration Incidents log.
- **Validation Layers**: Implement rigorous validation at both service and REST layers.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and regression testing supported by updated test frameworks.
- **Runbooks**: Detailed runbooks to guide deployment, rollback, and troubleshooting.
- **Documentation**: Keep architecture, module, and dependencies documentation current to ease transition and handover.
- **Incremental Rollout**: Conduct phased rollouts with feature flags where possible to reduce impact.

---

## Additional Notes

- Ensure continuous communication with development and QA teams on phase progress.
- Update the central knowledge base with phase deliverables and retrospectives.
- Use architectural diagrams to visualize impact of refactoring steps.
- Pay special attention to aligning versions of Jakarta EE and Hibernate ORM dependencies to avoid subtle runtime inconsistencies.
