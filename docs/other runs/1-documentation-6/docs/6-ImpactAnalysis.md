# Impact Analysis Document for Kitchensink Java EE to Java 21 and Spring Boot Migration

## 1. Legacy → Java 21 Mapping

| Legacy Feature / API                | Java 21 Equivalent / Best Practice                                  | Notes                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Java Language Version ≤ 8/11       | Java 21 Language & JVM Features                                    | Leverage enhanced switch expressions, record classes (if applicable), pattern matching, sealed classes, virtual threads, and new APIs. |
| java.util.logging (Logger)          | Use SLF4J + Logback (Spring Boot default)                         | Java 21 supports all logging frameworks, but Spring Boot standardizes SLF4J usage with Logback. Requires changing logger instantiation. |
| javax.persistence.EntityManager     | Jakarta Persistence API 3.1+ compatible with Java 21, Spring Data JPA Repositories | Spring Boot uses Spring Data JPA for simplified persistence layers. EntityManager methods replaced by JpaRepository interfaces. |
| jakarta.validation (Bean Validation) | Jakarta Validation API updated with Hibernate Validator 8+        | Validation annotations remain mostly the same; ensure compatibility of annotations namespaces with Java 21. Spring Boot auto-configures validation integrations. |
| JAXB (javax.xml.bind) in source    | replaced/supplemented by Jakarta XML Binding                      | Java 21 removed default JAXB modules; add dependencies or switch to Jackson XML if needed. In Kitchensink, JAXB used for @XmlRootElement in Member entity—ensure library inclusion. |
| Java EE Annotations (e.g., @Stateless) | Replaced by Spring annotations (@Service, @Component, @Repository) | EJB annotations removed; replaced with Spring stereotypes and dependency injection mechanisms. |
| CDI Annotations (@Inject, @Produces) | Replaced by Spring DI (@Autowired, @Bean, @Component)             | Change annotations and injection style; support constructor injection for enhanced testability and null-safety. |
| JAX-RS (@Path, @GET, etc.)         | Spring Web MVC / WebFlux REST Controllers (@RestController, @GetMapping, etc.) | Migrate REST endpoints annotations and routing. HTTP method, media types mapped to Spring annotations. |
| JUnit 4 Testing Framework           | Upgrade to JUnit 5 with Spring Boot Test integrations              | Enables modern test features, more flexible lifecycle management, and native Spring integration. |

## 2. Legacy → Spring Boot Mapping by Component

| Legacy Component / Framework                          | Spring Boot Equivalent / Migration Strategy                              |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.model.Member** | No change in entity design; ensure JPA annotations compatible; integrate with Spring Data JPA repositories. JAXB annotations (@XmlRootElement) require adding JAXB dependencies or switching to Jackson for JSON serialization. |
| **org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.controller.MemberController** | Replace CDI @Model and @Inject with Spring @Controller or @RestController and @Autowired or constructor injection. FacesContext replaced by Spring MVC model and view management. JSF UI needs complete rework using Spring MVC + Thymeleaf or other templating. |
| **org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.service.MemberRegistration** | Replace @Stateless EJB with Spring @Service. Use standard Spring-managed beans. Inject EntityManager replaced by Spring Data JPA repositories or EntityManager if direct use required. Event firing replaced by Spring ApplicationEvents or removed if unused. |
| **org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.data.MemberRepository** | Rewrite as Spring Data JPA interface extending JpaRepository<Member, Long>. Replace manual CriteriaBuilder queries with query methods or @Query annotations. CDI @ApplicationScoped replaced with @Repository or @Component. |
| **org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.data.MemberListProducer** | Convert CDI producer pattern to Spring @Component with @Bean definitions or @Service exposing member lists. Use Spring events and listeners if event propagation needed. |
| **org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.rest.MemberResourceRESTService** | Convert JAX-RS resources to Spring MVC REST controllers (@RestController). JAX-RS annotations (@Path, @GET, @POST) replaced with @RequestMapping/@GetMapping/@PostMapping etc. Response building with Spring ResponseEntity. Validation handled via Spring Validator or javax.validation integration. |
| **org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.rest.JaxRsActivator** | Not needed in Spring Boot; Spring Boot automatically configures REST endpoint scanning and exposure. Remove class. |
| **org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.util.Resources** | Replace CDI resource producers with Spring @Bean factory methods or auto-configured beans. Logger injection uses SLF4J with @Slf4j annotation or explicit injection. EntityManager is autowired by Spring Data JPA. |

## 3. Risk Register with Severity Levels

| Risk Description                                          | Severity | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **UI layer JSF (FacesContext, @Model) migration challenge**  | High     | Significant rewrite to Spring MVC + Thymeleaf or another frontend is needed; allocate UI rewrite effort. |
| **EJB @Stateless beans replaced with Spring services**      | Medium   | Refactoring of transactional and lifecycle semantics; ensure Spring Bean scopes and transactions match behavior. |
| **JAX-RS to Spring MVC REST conversion risk**               | Medium   | Differences in exception handling and validation require careful testing. Use Spring MVC idioms and ResponseEntity for control. |
| **Event mechanism discrepancies between CDI and Spring**    | Low      | Adapt CDI event firing to Spring ApplicationEvents; complexity if event-driven heavily used. |
| **JAXB dependency missing in Java 21 runtime (for XML binding)** | Medium   | Include JAXB APIs as dependencies or migrate XML processing to Jackson or other libraries compatible with Spring Boot. |
| **Logger migration and configuration differences**          | Low      | Change logger injection and usage to SLF4J conventions; align logging configuration centrally. |
| **Persistence context usage differences**                   | Medium   | Adjust EntityManager usage to Spring Data JPA patterns or ensure correct propagation of transactions. |
| **Testing framework upgrade from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5**       | Low      | Refactor test annotations and adapt to Spring Boot Test support for integration tests. |
| **Namespace and package renaming from javax.* to jakarta.* APIs** | Medium   | Use Eclipse Transformer or OpenRewrite to automate namespace refactoring and avoid runtime conflicts. |
| **Data repository manual queries refactoring risk**         | Medium   | Rewriting Criteria API queries to Spring Data may alter query behavior; thorough testing required. |

## 4. Recommended Migration Patterns per Component

| Component / Layer                      | Recommended Migration Pattern                                                                        | Notes                                                                                         |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Model (Entity Classes)                | Incremental refactoring with parallel validation for persistence compatibility                      | Maintain entity integrity; update JAXB annotations; use automated namespace transformation.   |
| Controller (UI Layer)                 | Complete rewrite using Spring MVC with Thymeleaf or frontend SPA framework                          | JSF to Spring MVC may not be automated; consider gradual rollout or Strangler Fig pattern.    |
| Service Layer                        | Replace EJB with Spring @Service components, apply Branch-by-Abstraction for transactional logic    | Maintain business logic encapsulation; refactor event firing to Spring events if used.        |
| Data Access Layer                   | Convert to Spring Data JPA repositories; utilize Incremental Refactoring pattern                    | Use JpaRepository interfaces; leverage Spring transaction management; rewrite query methods.  |
| REST Layer                          | Convert JAX-RS to Spring MVC REST controllers; adopt ResponseEntity and ExceptionHandler advice    | Migrate input validation and exception handling patterns; refactor JSON and XML bindings.     |
| Utility Layer (Logging, Resources)  | Replace CDI producers with Spring @Bean factories; adopt SLF4J & Logback standards                  | Centralize logging; ensure proper injection and configuration through Spring Boot practices.  |
| Cross-cutting Concerns              | Introduce Spring AOP where needed for logging, transactions, security                               | Reconcile differences in interceptor mechanisms between CDI/EJB and Spring AOP.               |

# Summary

This impact analysis reveals:

- The Kitchensink Java EE app extensively uses Jakarta EE technologies requiring replacement or adaptation to Spring Boot idioms on Java 21.

- Major challenges include UI migration from JSF and the rework of EJB Stateless beans and JAX-RS REST services.

- Persistence and validation layers map cleanly to Spring Data JPA and Spring Validation, but require namespace updates and query rewrites.

- Logging and resources should transition to Spring’s SLF4J and @Bean infrastructure.

- Tools such as Eclipse Transformer, OpenRewrite, and Spring Boot Migrator should be leveraged to automate namespace conversion and initial refactorings.

- Migration risks necessitate careful planning, automated testing, and phased rollout, ideally following branch-by-abstraction or strangler fig approaches.

- Regular audits and quality gates during sprints recommended to achieve compliance and smooth transition.
