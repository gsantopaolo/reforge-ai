# Kitchensink Java EE to Spring Boot Migration Roadmap

## Overview

This migration roadmap prioritizes refactoring tasks grouped into logical phases for the Kitchensink Java EE application modernization to Spring Boot on Java 21. It defines estimated timelines, dependencies, risk mitigations, and scheduled human review checkpoints. The roadmap aligns with best migration practices such as strangler fig and branch-by-abstraction, leveraging modern tools for automation and ensuring quality via audits each sprint.

---

## Phase 1: Preparation and Analysis (Duration: 2 weeks)

### Tasks:

- Conduct detailed dependency analysis using tools like jdeps to identify usage scope.
- Inventory all legacy frameworks, libraries, and API usages.
- Define automated test coverage baseline.
- Set up migration support tools: OpenRewrite, Eclipse Transformer, Spring Boot Migrator (SBM).
- Plan modularization where needed for incremental migration.

### Dependencies:

- None; initial planning phase.

### Risk Mitigations:

- Early detection of complex modules to adjust schedules.
- Validate tool readiness to avoid delays.

### Review Checkpoint:

- Review dependency and test coverage reports.
- Approve migration strategy and tool selection.

---

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure Migration (Duration: 3-4 weeks)

### Tasks:

- Migrate package namespaces from javax.* to jakarta.* using Eclipse Transformer or OpenRewrite.
- Replace java.util.logging with SLF4J and Logback; centralize logging configuration.
- Convert CDI annotations (@Inject, @Produces) to Spring DI (@Autowired, @Bean).
- Replace EJB @Stateless session beans with Spring @Service annotated components.
- Replace JDBC and EntityManager persistence with Spring Data JPA repositories.
- Adjust transaction management to Spring.

### Dependencies:

- Completion of phase 1.

### Risk Mitigations:

- Intensive testing of data and transaction layers.
- Logging migration validated to prevent audit gaps.

### Review Checkpoint:

- Code review on DI and persistence refactoring.
- Integration test suite run with logging validation.
- Manual audit of transaction behaviors.

---

## Phase 3: REST API Migration (Duration: 2-3 weeks)

### Tasks:

- Replace JAX-RS REST endpoints with Spring MVC @RestController classes.
- Migrate validation mechanisms to Spring Validation.
- Refactor response construction to use Spring ResponseEntity.
- Adjust exception handling to Spring @ControllerAdvice patterns.
- Remove JAX-RS activation classes (e.g., JaxRsActivator).

### Dependencies:

- Completion of phase 2.

### Risk Mitigations:

- Extensively test REST endpoints with automated integration tests.
- Validate JSON and XML bindings; include JAXB dependency if still required or migrate to Jackson XML.

### Review Checkpoint:

- API contract validation.
- Review exception handling and validation code.
- Confirm compliance with REST standards.

---

## Phase 4: UI Layer Migration (Duration: 4-6 weeks)

### Tasks:

- Replace JSF-based UI controllers (MemberController) and views with Spring MVC + Thymeleaf or modern SPA frameworks.
- Redesign FacesContext based messaging to Spring MVC model attributes or client-side notifications.
- Adapt form validations and error handling.
- Implement UI automated and manual tests.

### Dependencies:

- REST API layer migration complete (phase 3).

### Risk Mitigations:

- Allocate sufficient UI rewrite resources; JSF to Spring MVC rewrites are significant.
- Prototyping of UI components early to reduce surprises.
- Regression testing critical due to high UI impact.

### Review Checkpoint:

- Usability and functional tests review.
- Manual UI walkthroughs with stakeholders.
- Integration testing with backend.

---

## Phase 5: Testing Framework Upgrade and Automation (Duration: 2 weeks)

### Tasks:

- Upgrade unit and integration tests from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5.
- Migrate Arquillian tests to Spring Boot testing framework.
- Implement Continuous Integration (CI) quality gates with static analysis (e.g., SonarQube).
- Automate test execution and reporting.

### Dependencies:

- Majority of backend migration and UI modernization complete.

### Risk Mitigations:

- Parallel test migration to avoid coverage gaps.
- Build failure alerts for rapid feedback.

### Review Checkpoint:

- Approval of test quality coverage.
- CI pipeline validation.

---

## Phase 6: Final Stabilization and Optimization (Duration: 2 weeks)

### Tasks:

- Address post-migration bugs and performance optimizations.
- Update documentation and knowledge base.
- Conduct code audits and security reviews.
- Provide training and handover sessions.

### Dependencies:

- Completion of all prior migration phases.

### Risk Mitigations:

- Allocate buffer time for unforeseen issues.
- Monitor production environments for early detection.

### Review Checkpoint:

- Sign-off on code quality and security.
- Final knowledge base update review.

## Additional Notes on Risk Mitigations and Quality Gate Practices

- Use automated code transformation tools cautiously; conduct manual reviews after batch refactorings.
- Incorporate static analysis and coding standards enforcement at each sprint to maintain code quality.
- Employ human review checkpoints after each phase to catch integration issues and align with business requirements.
- Introduce automated regression testing suites evolving along phases to secure functionality.
- Carefully handle JAXB dependencies due to flexible XML/JSON bindings.
- Address UI complexity with dedicated frontend resources and prototype early.
- Apply strangler fig pattern where feasible to allow incremental coexistence of legacy and new components.
- Maintain detailed documentation and update the central knowledge base continuously.
