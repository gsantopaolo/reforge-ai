REST services interact with the service and data layers to fulfill client requests.\n\nAt runtime, user interactions flow from `MemberController` in the UI layer to the `MemberRegistration` service, which manipulates data via `MemberRepository`. Simultaneously, REST clients interact with `MemberResourceRESTService`, which coordinates with service and data layers similarly. The `MemberListProducer` assists in providing member lists to the UI. The modular package grouping provides separation of concerns between UI, business logic, data access, domain model, REST API exposure, and utilities.\n\nThis architecture enables clear layering, modularity, and single responsibility principles for maintainable extensible codebase structure.",

Migration Patterns\n\n### Strangler Fig Pattern\n- Gradual migration strategy where new functionality is developed in Spring Boot services, incrementally replacing legacy Java EE modules.\n- Useful for minimizing risk while preserving existing system behavior.\n- The legacy system is wrapped or proxied, routing new feature requests to new Spring Boot microservices while legacy functionality remains operational.\n- Applied in case studies migrating monolithic Java payment systems and other enterprise apps.\n\n### Branch-by-Abstraction\n- Introduce abstraction layers isolating legacy code from new implementations.\n- Swap internal implementations behind interfaces enabling incremental refactoring or replacement.\n- Allows parallel development and integration testing without disrupting production.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Tool Recommendations\n\n### OpenRewrite\n- Automated source code refactoring tool to facilitate large scale API migration.\n- Provides recipes to update Spring Boot versions, migrate configuration properties, update deprecated APIs.\n- Supports migration from Java EE to Spring Boot idioms.\n- Integrates into CI pipelines for continuous modernization.\n\n### jdeps\n- Java dependency analysis tool useful for assessing module dependencies.\n- Helps identify legacy library dependencies and migration impact.\n- Essential to understand transitive dependencies before migration to Spring Boot.\n\n### Flyway / Liquibase\n- Database schema migration/versioning tools.\n- Critical for managing persistent schema evolution during migration.\n- Support rollback, version tracking, seamless database refactoring.\n- Integrates well with Spring Boot to automate migration steps on startup.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Case Studies and References\n\n### Case Study: Monolithic Java to Spring Boot Microservices\n- Used Strangler Fig pattern for incremental module migration.\n- Employed OpenRewrite for automated codebase updates.\n- Managed database changes during migration with Flyway.\n- Outcome: Reduced risk migration with progressive rollout and retrofit.\n\n### Migration Toolkit for Runtimes (Red Hat)\n- Offers tools for automated migration analysis and advice.\n- Supports upgrading Java versions and migrating from JBoss EAP to modern runtimes.\n- Reference: https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/migration_toolkit_for_runtimes/\n\n### Research Paper on Strangler Fig Pattern Microservice Migration\n- Detailed strategy and outcomes on migrating legacy green button system to microservices.\n- Reference: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349568403_Microservice_Migration_Using_Strangler_Fig_Pattern_A_Case_Study_on_the_Green_Button_System\n\n### OpenRewrite Spring Boot Migration Recipes\n- Granular step-by-step code refactoring guidance.\n- Examples upgrading from Spring Boot 2 to 3.\n- Reference: https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/java/spring/boot3/upgradespringboot_3_0\n\n### Flyway and Liquibase Reference\n- Official documentation for managing database migrations in Spring ecosystems.\n- Reference: https://flywaydb.org/documentation/ and https://www.liquibase.org/get-started/quickstart\n\n---\n\nThis report consolidates best practices, recommended tools, and references to support efficient, repeatable, and low-risk migration of Java EE / Red Hat JBoss EAP applications and legacy frameworks to modern Spring Boot on Java 21 environments.",

The plan is designed for execution by an agentic AI augmented by human supervision.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Summary of Identified Modules and Coupling Analysis\n\nBased on the current project package structure and dependency graph:\n\n- **Modules identified:**\n  - util: `Resources` (Utility class, minimal dependencies)\n  - model: `Member` (Domain entity)\n  - data: `MemberRepository`, `MemberListProducer` (Persistence layer interacting with model)\n  - service: `MemberRegistration` (Business logic depending on data and model)\n  - controller: `MemberController` (UI interaction depending on service)\n  - rest: `JaxRsActivator`, `MemberResourceRESTService` (REST API layer interacting with service and data)\n\n- **Coupling considerations:**\n  - `util` is a low-dependency utility module.\n  - `model` encapsulates core domain entities, serves as a stabilized API.\n  - `data` depends on `model` entities.\n  - `service` depends on `data` and `model`.\n  - `controller` depends on `service`.\n  - `rest` depends on `service` and `data`.\n\n- **Least-coupled candidate module to extract first:**\n  - `util` due to minimal dependencies.\n  - However, its business value and domain importance are low.\n  - Next is `model` module since it provides stable domain abstraction.\n  - For migration impact and business value, `service` or `data` may be more beneficial.\n  - Balancing domain-driven boundaries and low coupling: `service` module `MemberRegistration` is a good candidate first incremental extraction.\n  \n---\n\n## 2. Migration Criteria\n\n- **Domain-Driven Design:** Respect bounded contexts \u2014 migrate cohesive domain service `MemberRegistration` and associated data access with minimal coupling on third-party legacy APIs.\n- **Spring Modulith intermediate modularization:** Organize the service and related modules into Spring Modulith modular jar maintaining boundaries to ease transition.\n- **Incremental migration:** Extract modules incrementally following the Strangler Fig pattern; migrate one module fully before next.\n- **Coexistence strategy:** Use gateway/proxy routing to forward requests to new Spring Boot modules or legacy components based on URI path or feature flags.\n- **OpenRewrite Spring Boot 3.2 recipes:** Automate source updates for build, configuration properties, and code refactoring for Spring Boot compatibility.\n- **Virtual threads:** Adopt virtual threads for high-throughput services (such as registration workflows) after proof of concept.\n  \n---\n\n## 3. Phased Extraction Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Extract Service Module (`MemberRegistration`)\n\n- **Description:** Extract the business logic service `MemberRegistration` along with its dependencies on `MemberRepository` and `Member` domain entity for independent compile and run in Spring Boot 3.2.\n- **Output:** Standalone Spring Boot module implementing member registration business rules.\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Create new Spring Modulith module `member-service`.\n  2. Migrate `MemberRegistration.java`.\n  3. Include `Member.java` entity to respect domain boundary.\n  4. Migrate essential repository interface `MemberRepository`.\n  5. Refactor code using OpenRewrite recipes to adopt Spring Boot idioms, Jakarta namespace.\n  6. Setup gateway routing to forward registration service calls to new module while legacy continues handling other requests.\n  7. Validate via integration tests.\n- **Tools:**  \n  - KnowledgeBaseTool  \n  - DomainModelAnalyzerTool  \n  - ModulithGeneratorTool  \n  - GatewayConfiguratorTool  \n  - OpenRewriteTool  \n  - CompilerTool  \n  - TestRunnerTool\n\n### Phase 2: Extract Data Module (`MemberRepository`, `MemberListProducer`)\n\n- **Description:** Extract data access components enabling independent database interaction in Spring Boot with JPA/Hibernate updated for Jakarta.\n- **Output:** Spring Boot data access module supporting service module.\n- **Steps:**  \n  1. Create new Spring Modulith module `member-data`.  \n  2. Migrate `MemberRepository`, `MemberListProducer`, and related configuration.  \n  3. Apply transformations via OpenRewrite recipes.  \n  4. Adjust `MemberRegistration` to consume new data module as dependency.  \n  5. Route data access calls via gateway as needed.  \n  6. Validate database connectivity and behavior.  \n- **Tools:** As Phase 1\n\n### Phase 3: Extract REST API Module (`MemberResourceRESTService`, `JaxRsActivator`)\n\n- **Description:** Expose business services through Spring MVC-based REST API replacing JAX-RS legacy.\n- **Output:** Spring Boot REST module exposing updated APIs.\n- **Steps:**  \n  1. Refactor REST layer from JAX-RS annotations to Spring Web annotations.  \n  2. Create Spring Modulith module `member-rest`.  \n  3. Forward API gateway routes selectively.  \n  4. Migrate tests to JUnit 5 with Spring Boot test support.  \n- **Tools:** As above\n\n### Phase 4: Extract Controller/UI Module (`MemberController`)\n\n- **Description:** Migrate UI controllers to Spring MVC.\n- **Output:** Spring Boot compatible UI controllers.\n- **Steps:**  \n  1. Create `member-controller` module.  \n  2. Migrate `MemberController` adapting to Spring MVC idioms.  \n  3. Integrate with rest module or service module as needed.  \n  4.

Migrate `Resources` class.  \n  2. Update references across modules.  \n- **Tools:** As above\n\n---\n\n## 4. Dependency Minimization Strategies\n\n- Use interface-based abstractions for interactions across modules.\n- Enforce module boundaries using Spring Modulith\u2019s enforced modularity.\n- Limit dependencies on legacy APIs by using anti-corruption layers.\n- Use virtual threads primarily in `member-service` module for improved concurrency and throughput where registration requests are high.\n- Apply automated refactoring with OpenRewrite for consistent update of dependencies and configuration.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Coexistence and Gateway/Proxy Routing Strategy\n\n- Introduce an API Gateway (e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway or Zuul) to act as a facade.\n- Routes incoming client requests based on context path or feature flags either to legacy monolith endpoints or to new Spring Boot modules.\n- Gradually migrate and switch routes from legacy to new modules with automatic fallback.\n- Maintain session and authentication across modules.\n- Monitor and log requests for monitoring incremental migration success.\n- Use HTTP reverse proxying, service discovery as needed for dynamic routing in containerized or cloud environments.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Agentic AI Detailed Actions for Migration Execution\n\n- Create new maven modules per phased plan: `member-service`, `member-data`, `member-rest`, `member-controller`, `member-util`.\n- Migrate Java source files per module:\n  - `member-service`: `src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/kitchensink/service/MemberRegistration.java`\n  - `member-data`: `MemberRepository.java`, `MemberListProducer.java`\n  - `member-rest`: `MemberResourceRESTService.java`, `JaxRsActivator.java`\n  - `member-controller`: `MemberController.java`\n  - `member-util`: `Resources.java`\n- Apply OpenRewrite Spring Boot 3.2 recipes: update dependencies, refactor Jakarta namespaces, configuration migrations.\n- Modify build scripts and configs to support Java 21.\n- Implement gateway configuration for routing proxy coexistence.\n- Introduce virtual threads in service methods with high concurrency.\n- Run automated tests and validate module isolation.\n- Generate updated UML and dependency diagrams.\n- Update documentation with migration notes and plans.\n\n---\n\n## 7.
