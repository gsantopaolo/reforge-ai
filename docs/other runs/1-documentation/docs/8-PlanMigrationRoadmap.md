# Kitchensink Java EE to Spring Boot Migration Roadmap (Java 21)

## 1. Comprehensive Overview and Key Takeaways

This migration project transitions the legacy Kitchensink Java EE application to a modern, modular Spring Boot ecosystem leveraging Java 21 features. The migration uses a domain-driven design approach combined with the Strangler Fig pattern for incremental module extraction and modernization while ensuring zero downtime.

Key points from available documentation and context:

- **Codebase Modularization:** Current monolithic modules (`util`, `model`, `data`, `service`, `controller`, `rest`) will be incrementally refactored into Spring Boot modules using Spring Modulith to maintain clear domain boundaries.
- **Refactoring Automation:** OpenRewrite will be used to automate common refactorings such as package renaming, API updates, and dependency changes.
- **Concurrency Improvements:** Virtual threads from Java 21 will enhance thread management for improved scalability and performance.
- **Migration Patterns:** The Strangler Fig pattern and branch-by-abstraction approach will help in gradual feature replacement and decoupling without disrupting existing functionality.
- **Technology Upgrades:** Migration involves moving legacy Java EE APIs to Jakarta EE namespaces, upgrading logging frameworks to support modern APIs, replacing outdated date/time APIs with `java.time`, and adjusting for deprecated or removed APIs.
- **Risk Management:** Careful planning for technical risks (e.g., dependency conflicts, API incompatibilities) and operational risks (e.g., deployment issues) with mitigation strategies including incremental validation and human review.
- **Quality Assurance:** Multiple quality gates, compliance audits, and architectural reviews are embedded as checkpoints to maintain high standards.

## 2. Prioritized Refactoring Tasks Grouped into Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation and Foundation
- Audit existing dependencies and identify deprecated/removed components.
- Set up Spring Modulith with base project structure.
- Establish CI/CD pipelines incorporating OpenRewrite automation.
- Upgrade build tools and configure Java 21 compilation and execution settings.

### Phase 2: Core API and Namespace Migration
- Perform Jakarta namespace migration for all Java EE APIs.
- Refactor legacy logging libraries to SLF4J + Logback or Log4j2 with appropriate bridges.
- Replace all uses of legacy `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` with `java.time` APIs.
- Introduce virtual threads incrementally on IO-bound service layers.

### Phase 3: Domain Module Extraction and Refactoring
- Extract `util` and `model` modules as standalone Spring Boot modules.
- Refactor domain entities, DTOs, and utility classes for immutability and thread-safety.
- Migrate `data` module integrating Spring Data repositories with reactive support.

### Phase 4: Service and Controller Modernization
- Modularize `service` layer with Spring services and transactional boundaries.
- Update business logic applying branch-by-abstraction pattern to introduce new implementations.
- Refactor `controller` and `rest` modules to use Spring WebFlux where applicable.
- Integrate asynchronous processing using virtual threads.

### Phase 5: Testing, Validation, and Optimization
- Implement comprehensive integration and contract tests per module.
- Conduct load testing leveraging virtual threads for concurrency benchmarks.
- Perform static code analysis and OpenRewrite final passes.
- Optimize configurations and remove deprecated code paths.

### Phase 6: Deployment Rollout and Monitoring
- Deploy incrementally using feature toggles and Strangler Fig gates.
- Monitor application metrics and logs for runtime issues.
- Finalize decommissioning of legacy Java EE containers.

| Phase                         | Duration Estimate | Dependencies                          | Key Risks & Mitigations                                       |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Phase 1: Preparation           | 1 week            | None                                | Risks: Misconfiguration of build or environment; Mitigation: Dry-runs and automated testing |
| Phase 2: API & Namespace Migrations | 2 weeks          | Phase 1 completion                   | Risks: Jakarta transition mismatches; Mitigation: Automated refactoring + manual code reviews |
| Phase 3: Module Extraction     | 3 weeks           | Phase 2 completion                   | Risks: Domain model inconsistencies; Mitigation: Incremental tests and DDD validation sessions |
| Phase 4: Service & Controller  | 3 weeks           | Phase 3 completion                   | Risks: Feature regressions; Mitigation: Branch-by-abstraction and feature toggles |
| Phase 5: Testing & Optimization| 2 weeks           | Phase 4 completion                   | Risks: Insufficient test coverage; Mitigation: Comprehensive automated tests and analysis tools |
| Phase 6: Deployment & Monitoring | 1 week           | Phase 5 completion                   | Risks: Production instability; Mitigation: Canary releases and close monitoring |

Total estimated timeline: approximately 12 weeks.

## 4. Human Review Checkpoints for Quality Gates and Audits

- **Post-Phase 1:** Review build system readiness, OpenRewrite setup, and baseline CI/CD pipeline.
- **Post-Phase 2:** Conduct architectural review of Jakarta namespace migration and logging/date-time refactoring correctness.
- **Post-Phase 3:** Domain model and module design audit aligning with domain-driven design principles.
- **Post-Phase 4:** Code reviews focused on branch-by-abstraction implementation and backward compatibility.
- **Post-Phase 5:** Comprehensive testing audits including performance, security, and compliance validations.
- **Pre-Phase 6:** Final executive review for deployment readiness including risk assessment sign-off.
