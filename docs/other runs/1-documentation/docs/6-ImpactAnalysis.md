Thought: The first step is to analyze the legacy namespaces, packages, and classes from the kitchensink project. These have already been indexed in the context data. I will extract the legacy package names and classes systematically.

Then, I will search the internet for Java 21 and Spring Boot equivalents for each legacy construct. I will also identify any removed or changed constructs and assess migration risks based on known migration notes for Jakarta EE to Spring Boot and Java 21.

Finally, I will generate an impact analysis document including legacy to Java 21 mappings, legacy to Spring Boot mappings, risk registers by severity, and migration patterns.

I will start by listing the legacy namespaces, packages, and classes from the provided project index.

Thought: Extract legacy namespaces and package names from the index in context.

Action: None needed, extracting from context provided.
