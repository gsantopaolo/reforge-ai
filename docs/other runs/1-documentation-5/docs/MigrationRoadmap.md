Migration Roadmap for kitchensink Project
=========================================

Overview
--------
This Migration Roadmap defines the prioritized phases, dependencies, and risk mitigation steps for modernizing the kitchensink project codebase. It is grounded in an analysis of the current dependency graph, module structure, modernization incidents, and hotspot ranking across layers.

Phases and Prioritization
-------------------------
The modernization efforts are grouped into the following sequential phases:

### Phase 1: Dependency and Environment Validation
- **Objectives**
  - Verify and document complete migration from `javax.*` to `jakarta.*` namespaces.
  - Validate configuration files (`persistence.xml`, `beans.xml`, `web.xml`) for deprecated or incompatible settings.
  - Confirm compatibility of the application server/container with Jakarta EE 10+ dependencies.
  - Confirm no usage of removed or deprecated JVM flags.
- **Modules impacted**
  - Entire codebase (cross-cutting concerns).
  - Configuration files in project root or resources.
- **Dependencies**
  - Must precede code-level API upgrades to avoid runtime incompatibilities.
- **Risk Mitigation**
  - Perform thorough configuration scans.
  - Use automated namespace migration tools.
  - Implement unit and integration tests for configuration changes.

### Phase 2: Library Upgrades and Testing Framework Modernization
- **Objectives**
  - Upgrade Jakarta EE dependencies to their latest stable releases.
  - Upgrade testing dependencies from JUnit 4.13.1 to JUnit 5.
  - Validate Hibernate ORM tooling compatibility with new Jakarta EE versions.
- **Modules impacted**
  - All modules referencing Jakarta EE APIs and third-party libraries.
  - Test modules affected by JUnit upgrade.
- **Dependencies**
  - After Phase 1.
  - Requires parallel update streams for runtime and test dependencies.
- **Risk Mitigation**
  - Use controlled environment to test upgraded dependencies.
  - Utilize dependency management tools to detect conflicts.
  - Run full regression test suite post-upgrade.

### Phase 3: API and Code Migration
- **Objectives**
  - Confirm and finalize migration of Java EE APIs to Jakarta EE APIs.
  - Validate usage of CDI event injection (`@Inject Event<T>`) against updated container implementations.
  - Align REST endpoint annotations and JAX-RS usage to latest Jakarta REST specs.
- **Modules impacted**
  - `org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.controller` (MemberController.java)
  - `org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.service` (MemberRegistration.java)
  - `org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.rest` (JaxRsActivator.java, MemberResourceRESTService.java)
  - `org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.data` (MemberListProducer, MemberRepository)
- **Dependencies**
  - Must follow library upgrades (Phase 2).
- **Risk Mitigation**
  - Static code analysis and automated refactoring tools.
  - Extensive regression testing of endpoints and transactional logic.
  - Peer code reviews to enforce API correctness.

### Phase 4: Continuous Static Analysis and Automation
- **Objectives**
  - Integrate OpenRewrite recipes and static analysis tools into CI/CD pipeline.
  - Automate detection and remediation of deprecated API usages.
  - Establish continuous monitoring for emerging modernization incidents.
- **Modules impacted**
  - Entire codebase continuously.
- **Dependencies**
  - Can be started in parallel with or after Phase 3.
- **Risk Mitigation**
  - Define clear update policies for static analysis rules.
  - Regularly update automation tools to accommodate new Jakarta EE releases.

Phased Timeline (Example)
-------------------------
| Phase | Duration (Weeks) | Dependencies                  | Milestones                     |
|-------|------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1     | 2                | None                         | Configuration validation report |
| 2     | 3                | Phase 1 completion            | Updated libraries and test framework |
| 3     | 4                | Phase 2 completion            | API migrations completed        |
| 4     | Ongoing          | Phase 3 partial or complete   | CI/CD integration and reports   |

Prioritized Refactoring Tasks Summary
------------------------------------
- Validate and migrate namespaces in all sources and configuration files.
- Upgrade Jakarta EE and Hibernate ORM versions.
- Migrate JUnit tests to JUnit 5.
- Adjust CDI event injection for compatibility.
- Review REST API annotations and implementation to meet Jakarta REST standards.
- Introduce automated static checks for ongoing compliance.

Known Risks and Mitigation
--------------------------
- **Incomplete Namespace Migration:** Leads to runtime failures.
  - *Mitigation:* Automated namespace migration tools and manual verification.
- **Dependency Conflicts on Upgrades:** May cause runtime errors.
  - *Mitigation:* Use dependency management and staged upgrade approach.
- **Test Failures Post Framework Upgrade:** Could reduce confidence in stability.
  - *Mitigation:* Gradual test suite migration with parallel runs.
- **Static Analysis False Positives/Negatives:** May reduce effectiveness.
  - *Mitigation:* Regular updates and tuning of analysis tools.

Conclusion
----------
This roadmap defines a staged, prioritized modernization plan for kitchensink that aligns technical upgrade activities with risk-aware scheduling. It aims to ensure stability during transition and sustain forward compatibility with Jakarta EE evolution.
