Modernization Incidents List for kitchensink Project:

1. Deprecated Java 10 APIs:
   - No usages of deprecated Java 10 APIs were detected in the scanned code modules including Member.java, MemberRegistration.java, and MemberController.java.

2. Removed JVM Flags:
   - No evidence of deprecated or removed JVM flags was found in current codebase or project configuration.

3. Library Upgrade Needs:
   - Dependencies currently in use:
     - jakarta.enterprise:jakarta.enterprise.cdi-api:4.0.1 (provided)
     - junit:junit:4.13.1 (test)
     - org.hibernate.orm:hibernate-jpamodelgen:6.2.13.Final (provided)
     - jakarta.activation:jakarta.activation-api:2.1.2 (provided)
     - org.hibernate.validator:hibernate-validator:8.0.0.Final (provided)
     - jakarta.validation:jakarta.validation-api:3.0.2 (provided)
     - jakarta.persistence:jakarta.persistence-api:3.1.0 (provided)
     - jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api:3.1.0 (provided)
     - jakarta.faces:jakarta.faces-api:4.0.1 (provided)
     - org.jboss.arquillian.junit:arquillian-junit-container:1.7.0.Final (test)
     - org.jboss.arquillian.protocol:arquillian-protocol-servlet-jakarta:1.7.0.Final (test)
   - Recommendations:
     - Continuously monitor and upgrade Jakarta EE dependencies to latest stable releases.
     - Validate Hibernate and related ORM tooling compatibility with the Jakarta version used.
     - junit:junit:4.13.1 is somewhat dated; consider upgrading to JUnit 5 for enhanced testing features.

4. Migration Blockers:
   - Transition completeness from javax.* to jakarta.* namespaces must be verified across entire codebase to prevent runtime incompatibilities.
   - Configuration files (persistence.xml, beans.xml, web.xml) must be checked for deprecated or incompatible settings.
   - CDI event injection usage (e.g., `@Inject Event<Member>`) must be validated against current container implementations to avoid injection failures.
   - Verify REST endpoint annotations and JAX-RS usage are aligned to latest Jakarta REST specifications.

5. Static Analysis Observations:
   - No highlighted direct usage of deprecated APIs or removed flags in given source files.
   - Suggest regular application of OpenRewrite recipes and static code analysis tools to catch emerging deprecated usages and configure automated fixes.

Summary:
No immediate critical deprecated API uses or removed JVM flags were found in core modules. The main modernization focus should be on ensuring dependency versions remain up to date and consistent with Jakarta EE 10+ requirements, verifying complete namespace migration, and validating configuration files. For long-term maintainability and forward compatibility, incorporate static analysis and automated rewrite recipes into CI pipelines to proactively detect any new modernization incidents.

This detailed Modernization Incidents List should guide the kitchensink project team in planning their upgrade and migration activities effectively.
