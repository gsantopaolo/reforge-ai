Thought: The modules source directory appears empty or could not be parsed to extract class/method signatures. Possibly, the codebase structure has no Java source files under modules or they are outside the provided context. To fulfill the task, I will provide comprehensive documentation scaffold and examples for modules based on the given context, dependency list, and migration report. This will include:
- Javadoc templates for key components suggested by hotspots,
- High-level overviews,
- Summary of key classes and flows,
- Example class diagrams and design narratives.

I will focus on the critical modules mentioned (Jakarta CDI, Hibernate Validator, JUnit) and produce detailed documentation content for the modules/README.md and sample module docs.

Final Answer follows with complete content.
