# Modernization Migration Roadmap

This document outlines a phased plan to migrate the codebase from Java 10 to Java 21 and modernize associated dependencies and APIs. It details priorities, dependencies, and risk mitigation strategies to achieve a stable, secure, and high-performance system.

## Rationale: Why Upgrade Dependencies When Migrating from Java 10 to Java 21?

Migrating across nine major Java versions (from 10 to 21) is significant and introduces multiple challenges:

- **JDK API and Feature Changes:** Many Java APIs have been deprecated, removed, or fundamentally changed.
- **Library Compatibility:** Most dependencies were compiled and tested against older Java versions. Using outdated libraries can cause runtime errors, incompatibilities, or subtle bugs under Java 21.
- **Taking Advantage of Enhancements:** New Java versions unlock performance improvements, security enhancements, and language features, but third-party libraries must also support these changes.
- **Security and Bug Fixes:** Libraries often release versions aligned with newer JDKs that address known security flaws and bugs.

Therefore, **upgrading dependencies is indispensable** to ensure compatibility and stability during the migration. Simply migrating the JDK without corresponding dependency updates risks build failures, runtime errors, and degraded application behavior.

Incremental, tool-assisted migration (e.g., OpenRewrite Java 21 migration recipes) helps identify incompatible APIs in both your code and dependencies and guides the necessary changes.

## Migration Phases Overview

| Phase | Focus Area | Key Modules/Technologies | Priority | Dependencies | Timeline |
|-------|------------|--------------------------|----------|--------------|----------|
| 1     | Preparation & Environment Setup | All | High | None | Week 1 |
| 2     | Dependency Upgrade & Code Migration | Jakarta APIs, Hibernate, Testing, Others | High | Phase 1 | Weeks 2-5 |
| 3     | Testing Framework Migration | JUnit 4 to 5 | Medium | Phase 2 | Weeks 6-7 |
| 4     | Deprecated API Refactoring | JAXB, Faces, WS-RS | Medium | Phase 2 | Weeks 7-9 |
| 5     | Security & JVM Flag Updates | JVM Config, Security Manager | High | Phase 1 | Weeks 3-5 (parallel) |
| 6     | Stabilization & Validation | All | High | Phases 2-5 | Weeks 10-12 |

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Preparation & Environment Setup

- Establish baseline: analyze current codebase and dependencies for deprecated APIs.
- Configure build environment for Java 21 compatibility.
- Introduce migration tooling (e.g., OpenRewrite).
- Document current incidents and create migration backlog.

### Phase 2: Dependency Upgrade & Code Migration

- Upgrade all critical dependencies to versions supporting Java 21.
- Refactor application code for compatibility with migrated dependencies and Java 21 APIs.
- Use automated migration recipes to detect and fix deprecated API usages.
- Heavy focus on Jakarta Enterprise CDI, Hibernate Validator, and other core libraries.
- Run thorough module/unit tests throughout.

### Phase 3: Testing Framework Migration

- Transition from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5 to leverage modern testing capabilities and compatibility with Java 21.
- Refactor test suites incrementally to minimize risk.

### Phase 4: Deprecated API Refactoring

- Address deprecated API usage in JAXB, Jakarta Faces, Jakarta WS-RS per new Java and Jakarta standards.
- Validate API contract stability through integration and UI testing.

### Phase 5: Security & JVM Flag Updates

- Remove deprecated JVM flags incompatible with Java 21.
- Replace code depending on the deprecated Security Manager with modern security mechanisms.

### Phase 6: Stabilization & Validation

- Conduct full system validation with updated dependencies and Java 21 runtime.
- Resolve migration incidents and finalize documentation updates.
- Provide developer knowledge transfer sessions.

## Key Risk Mitigation Strategies

- Employ automated tools and recipes tailored for Java 21 migration.
- Maintain continuous integration with incremental builds and tests.
- Engage module owners in phased migration planning.
- Incremental dependency upgrades before major API and feature refactoring.
- Regular security auditing aligned with JVM and library changes.

## Conclusion

Migrating from Java 10 to Java 21 is a comprehensive process impacting JDK, libraries, and application code. Adequate dependency upgrades are essential to ensure compatibility, performance, and security. This roadmap guides a phased, incremental modernization minimizing disruption while leveraging new platform benefits.
