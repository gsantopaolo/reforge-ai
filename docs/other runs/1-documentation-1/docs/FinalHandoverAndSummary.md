# Modernization Summary Report

---

## Executive Overview

This report presents a consolidated view of the modernization project to migrate the codebase and dependencies from Java 10 to Java 21. It covers progress on completed phases, outlines risk mitigation strategies, and summarizes performance improvements achieved and targeted. The objective is to ensure a secure, performant, and maintainable application aligning with current platform standards.

---

## Completed Phases Summary

### Phase 1: Preparation & Environment Setup
- Baseline analysis conducted on the current codebase and dependency versions.
- Build and test environments configured for Java 21 compatibility.
- Migration tooling such as OpenRewrite introduced to identify deprecated usage.
- Migration incidents logged and backlog created for targeted remediation.

### Phase 2: Dependency Upgrade & Code Migration (In Progress)
- Core dependencies such as Jakarta Enterprise CDI, Hibernate Validator, and Jakarta APIs reviewed for version compatibility.
- Initial refactoring started to remove deprecated APIs, align with new Java 21 features.
- Migration recipes applied to automate detection of deprecated method calls.
- Testing modules and integration verification ongoing concurrently.

*Note:* Phases 3 through 6 are planned but remain to be initiated or completed.

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate risks associated with a major upgrade across multiple dependencies and Java versions, the following strategies have been implemented:

- **Automated Tooling:** Leveraging migration tools (OpenRewrite, jdepScan) reduces manual errors and ensures comprehensive coverage of deprecated API usage.
- **Incremental Upgrades:** Dependencies upgraded in phases to control complexity and isolate issues.
- **Continuous Integration:** Builds and test suites run on every commit to catch regressions immediately.
- **Incident Log Management:** A documented incident management process guides issue resolution with ownership and priorities clearly assigned.
- **Engaged Stakeholders:** Module and dependency owners actively engaged to provide domain-specific insights and support migration efforts.
- **Security Focus:** Special attention to removing deprecated security manager features and updating JVM flags to align with Java 21 security models.

## Performance Improvements & Enhancements

- **Java 21 Runtime Benefits:** Migration targets leveraging JVM performance improvements, including improved garbage collection, enhanced JIT optimizations, and modern language features to promote cleaner, more efficient code.
- **Updated Jakarta APIs:** Upgrading Jakarta Enterprise CDI and related APIs ensures better runtime efficiency and compliance with the latest specifications.
- **Testing Modernization:** Planned migration to JUnit 5 promises faster test execution and improved reporting.
- **Reduced Deprecated Code:** Removing obsolete features and APIs reduces technical debt, leading to fewer runtime warnings and improved stability.
- **Dependency Streamlining:** By pruning outdated libraries and aligning versions, dependency bloat is minimized, improving build and deploy times.
