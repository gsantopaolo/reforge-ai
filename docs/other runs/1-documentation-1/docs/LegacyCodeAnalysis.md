### Modernization Incidents List
| **ID** | **Module** | **Description** | **Severity** | **Status** | **Resolution** |
|--------|------------|------------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1      | Jakarta Enterprise CDI API | Deprecated dependency management features may need to be replaced or re-implemented. | High | Open | Replace with updated Jakarta APIs and ensure CDI compliance. |
| 2      | Hibernate Validator | The hibernate-validator version 8.0 might use deprecated methods from prior versions. | Medium | Open | Upgrade to stable version as per Hibernate support list. Consult migration docs. |
| 3      | JUnit | Dependency on JUnit 4.13.1; consider migrating to JUnit 5 to avoid deprecated usage patterns. | Medium | Open | Transition to JUnit 5 features where applicable. |
| 4      | Jakarta XML Bind | The usage of @XmlJavaTypeAdapter and similar bindings may be subject to deprecation warnings. | Medium | Open | Review and replace or adjust logic per new Jakarta XML standards. |
| 5      | Jakarta Faces | Current version may not support the latest JSF features, leading to performance and compatibility issues. | High | Open | Upgrade to latest Jakarta Faces version to ensure backwards compatibility. |
| 6      | Jakarta WS-RS | Potential usage of deprecated RESTful features in Jakarta standards in old code patterns. | Medium | Open | Refactor deprecated REST APIs in code to use updated Jakarta standards. |
| 7      | Jakarta Validation | The version being used (3.0.2) possibly includes deprecated validators that need replacement. | Medium | Open | Upgrade to newer validation methods in Jakarta’s specification. |
| 8      | JEP 411: Security Manager | As the security manager is deprecated, assess security elements of the code. | High | Open | Adapt security practices to align with updated Java security measures. |
| 9      | JVM Flags | Current build might include deprecated JVM flags no longer recognized in newer versions of Java. | High | Open | Consult the JVM documentation and update configurations. |

### Key Actions
- **Library Updates:** Ensure that all libraries are updated to versions that do not use deprecated features.
- **Code Refactoring:** Actively refactor the codebase to remove any deprecated patterns identified in the dependencies.
- **Documentation Review:** Regularly consult migration guides provided by library maintainers, specifically focusing on major library upgrades such as Hibernate, JUnit, and Jakarta technologies.

### Next Steps
- **Run Static Analysis:** Perform a comprehensive static analysis across the repository’s codebase to automatically identify more instances of deprecated APIs and usage patterns.
- **Leverage JDEP tools:** Utilize tools like `jdeprscan` to analyze the codebase more thoroughly for any additional deprecated methods or classes.
- **Establish Migration Sprints:** Organize development sprints focused on addressing each incident documented and ensuring compliance with newer standards.
