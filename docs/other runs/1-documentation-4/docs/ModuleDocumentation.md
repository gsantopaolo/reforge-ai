### Key Classes & Methods

```java
/**
 * Repository class managing database operations for Members.
 */
public class MemberRepository {

    /**
     * Finds a member by their unique ID.
     * @param id unique member ID
     * @return Member entity or null if not found
     */
    public Member findById(Long id) { ... }

    /**
     * Finds a member by their email address.
     * @param email email string to query
     * @return Member entity or null if not found
     */
    public Member findByEmail(String email) { ... }

    /**
     * Lists all members ordered alphabetically by name.
     * @return list of members
     */
    public List<Member> findAllOrderedByName() { ... }
}

/**
 * Produces the list of members and handles member list change events.
 */
// Other methods:
public class MemberListProducer {

    public List<Member> getMembers() { ... }

    public void onMemberListChanged(Member member) { ... }

    public List<Member> retrieveAllMembersOrderedByName() { ... }
}
```

    public void initNewMember() { ... }

    /**
     * Handles member registration action triggered from UI.

## High-Level Overview

The Kitchensink application is a Java EE example demonstrating best practices for building a full-stack application using JPA entities (model), CDI injection, RESTful services, JSF UI backing beans (controller), persistence layers (data), and supporting utilities (util). 

The core flow includes registering members, validating data at both UI and REST levels, managing member persistence, and exposing member resources via REST API. The layered approach ensures separation of concerns between presentation, business logic, data management, and integration interfaces.
