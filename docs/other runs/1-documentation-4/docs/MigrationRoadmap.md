# Migration Roadmap for Java EE Modernization Project

---

## 1. Introduction and Overview

This document outlines the planned phases, dependencies, and risk mitigation strategies involved in modernizing the Kitchensink Java EE application and its ecosystem components. The roadmap focuses on prioritizing refactoring tasks, grouping module changes into logical migration phases, and scheduling these phases against the overall project timeline to ensure a smooth transition, minimal disruption, and improved maintainability.

---

## 2. Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Dependency and Environment Upgrade

**Objective:** Prepare modernization baseline by upgrading core dependencies, ensuring build and runtime environments support latest Java EE (Jakarta EE) standards.

**Tasks:**
- Upgrade major dependencies to stable Jakarta EE equivalents:
  - Replace `javax.ws.rs-api` and `org.jboss.resteasy` libraries with Jakarta EE 9+ compatible versions.
  - Upgrade Hibernate Core ORM from 5.4.x to latest stable (e.g., 6.2.x), addressing deprecated methods.
  - Replace `javax.servlet-api` 3.1.0 with Jakarta Servlet API 5.0 or newer.
  - Validate no deprecated Jakarta Activation APIs or transaction APIs are used.
- Upgrade build tools (e.g., Maven Compiler Plugin) to support Java 11 or 17 if applicable.
- Verify compatibility and configuration for all `provided` scoped dependencies to ensure runtime availability and avoid conflicts.
- Conduct static analysis scans to detect deprecated API usages (Hibernate Validator annotations, transaction management frameworks).
- Establish baseline integration and unit tests to cover existing functionality.

**Dependencies:** None; this is the foundational groundwork for subsequent migration.

**Risks:**
- Compatibility issues causing build or runtime failures.
- Runtime exceptions due to missing `provided` dependencies.
  
**Mitigation:**
- Isolate upgrades in controlled feature branches.
- Automate build and test executions.
- Document environment dependencies precisely.

### Phase 2: Logging Framework Modernization

**Objective:** Standardize and upgrade the logging infrastructure for better observability and maintenance.

**Tasks:**
- Refactor the `util` moduleâ€™s `Resources` class to produce injection-compatible loggers relying on SLF4J or Jakarta Commons Logging to allow flexible bindings.
- Replace any legacy or custom logging code with standardized API usage.
- Integrate centralized logging solutions if applicable (e.g., ELK stack connectors).
- Update logging configurations to support per-module or per-package verbosity as needed.
- Validate logging does not introduce performance bottlenecks.

**Dependencies:** Completion of dependency upgrades in Phase 1, especially any logging backend libraries.

**Risks:**
- Inconsistent logging formats causing trouble in log aggregation.
- Logging changes affecting performance.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement phased rollout with dual logging enabled during transition.
- Conduct load testing and profile logging impact.

---

### Phase 3: Data and Persistence Layer Refactoring

**Objective:** Improve domain entity models and persistence layer in `model` and `data` modules to leverage new Jakarta Persistence capabilities and optimize queries.

**Tasks:**
- Migrate `Member` entity and related domain models from deprecated JPA annotations to updated Jakarta Persistence annotations.
- Refactor `MemberRepository` and `MemberListProducer` to use enhanced query features.
- Address any deprecated Hibernate Validator constraints by upgrading to latest validation annotations.
- Modify transaction management to comply with updated Jakarta Transaction API.
- Add integration tests for data retrieval and persistence.

**Dependencies:** Phases 1 and 2 completed, as persistence-related dependencies and logging diagnostics are needed.

**Risks:**
- Data integrity issues during schema or annotation changes.
- Regression in data access performance.

**Mitigation:**
- Use transactional testing and rollback in automated tests.
- Incremental migration with fallback paths if needed.

---

### Phase 4: Business Logic and Service Layer Modernization

**Objective:** Refactor the `service` module's business logic to align with new Java EE standards and improve maintainability.

**Tasks:**
- Review `MemberRegistration` service logic for deprecated API calls or patterns.
- Update validation and error handling.
- Introduce any new features or restructuring needed to separate concerns cleanly.
- Ensure integration tests cover service-level logic.

**Dependencies:** Completion of persistence layer improvements in Phase 3.

**Risks:**
- Business rule regressions impacting application correctness.

**Mitigation:**
- Rigorous unit and integration testing.
- Peer code reviews.

---

### Phase 5: User Interface and REST API Migration

**Objective:** Migrate JSF backing beans in `controller` and RESTful endpoints in `rest` modules to Jakarta EE APIs and improved validation.

**Tasks:**
- Update JSF managed bean annotations and lifecycle to Jakarta EE equivalents.
- Refactor `MemberController` to adopt newer CDI scopes and injection models.
- Upgrade REST services to use latest Jakarta RESTful Web Services API.
- Improve validation logic using Jakarta Bean Validation and handle validation responses appropriately.
- Verify REST client compatibility and error handling.
- Update integration and end-to-end UI tests.

**Dependencies:** Completion of business logic updates in Phase 4 as UI relies on service layer.

**Risks:**
- UI breakages or REST API incompatibilities.
- Validation errors mishandled causing poor client experience.

**Mitigation:**
- Maintain parallel API versions during migration if feasible.
- Extensive testing with UI frameworks and REST clients.

---

### Phase 6: Operational and Deployment Runbooks Update

**Objective:** Ensure that operational procedures are updated to reflect modernization changes.

**Tasks:**
- Update runbooks to incorporate new deployment steps, monitoring, and troubleshooting procedures.
- Document procedures to handle new logging, transaction, and validation behaviors.
- Train operators and provide updated contacts and escalation paths.

**Dependencies:** All development phases completed and stable.

**Risks:**
- Operational errors due to outdated runbooks.

**Mitigation:**
- Review and simulate runbook steps prior to production rollout.

## 3. Dependencies and Constraints

- Dependency upgrades (Phase 1) are mandatory prior to all other phases.
- Logging modernization depends on stable dependencies but can proceed in parallel with later phases.
- Data layer changes depend on dependency and logging completion.
- Service layer changes depend on stable data layer.
- UI and REST API modernization depend on service layer readiness.
- Operational runbooks update only after core system is modernized and stable.

## 4. Risk Identification and Mitigation

| Risk                                 | Impact      | Mitigation Strategy                                   |
