| Activation and other Jakarta EE modules        | Managed transitively by Spring Boot starters          | Low: Usually no direct action needed                                                 | Verify dependencies in gradle/maven                                                 |
| Legacy logging (`org.jboss.logging`)            | SLF4J + Logback as Spring Boot logging backend         | Low: Configure Logback with appropriate logging configuration                       | Migrate logging configs; replace logger usage                                        |

## 7. Summary

The kitchensink legacy application consists of layered architecture typical of Java EE on Red Hat JBoss, involving distinct packages for utilities, controllers, domain models, services, data repositories, and REST endpoints. Migrating to Java 21 and Spring Boot entails:

- Refactoring namespaces from legacy `org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.*` to a clean Spring Boot style package (e.g., `com.example.kitchensink.*`) with layered organization.

- Replacing Jakarta EE standards such as CDI, EJB, JPA, and JAX-RS with Spring Dependency Injection, Services, Spring Data JPA, and Spring MVC REST.

- Migration risks focus heavily on transactional boundaries, dependency injection differences, REST endpoint rewriting, and frontend technology changes.

- Recommended migration patterns include incremental rewriting (Strangler Fig), abstraction layers (Branch-by-Abstraction), and modularization.

- Use automated tools to convert packages from `javax.*` to `jakarta.*` namespaces and refactor legacy APIs to modern Spring idioms.

- Test rigorously during migration to ensure behavioral fidelity.

This document provides a comprehensive map and risk assessment for the migration, serving as a blueprint for phased modernization with prioritized business value modules (services, data, REST APIs) and allows scheduling documentation and audit tasks in alignment with an Agile sprint cadence.
