# Code Generation Improvement Suggestions

## Measuring Results

* **Issue:** Absence of quantitative metrics to evaluate agent performance and code quality.
* **Proposed Improvements:**

  * Define and track metrics such as Pass\@k, compilation success rate, code coverage percentage, and iteration count per transformation citeturn3file0.
  * Automate dashboard generation for these metrics to monitor progress over time.

## Unit Testing & Playwright Integration

* **Issue:** Generated code lacks automated validation.
* **Proposed Improvements:**

  * Introduce a **TestGen Agent** that uses LLMs to generate JUnit tests for transformed Java components.
  * Add a **UI Test Agent** leveraging Playwright to script end-to-end tests for any generated web UI modules, ensuring functional coverage.

## Model Evaluation: Gemini 2.5 Pro & Claude 3.7

* **Issue:** Limited evaluation of alternative LLMs due to rate-limits.
* **Proposed Improvements:**

  * Schedule dedicated test runs against Gemini 2.5 Pro for code completion and transformation tasks.
  * Integrate Claude 3.7 into the multi-agent pipeline to compare synthesis quality and prompt-handling efficiency.
  * Benchmark these models against existing baselines (e.g., GPT-4) on transformation accuracy and build success.

## 5.4 Additional Enhancements

* **Parallel Execution:** Enable parallel processing of independent tasks (e.g., separate modules) to reduce total pipeline time.
* **Context Management:** Apply hierarchical context chunking and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to support large codebases.
* **Human-in-the-Loop Feedback:** Build feedback agents that solicit developer reviews on generated code, iterating prompts and improving quality.
* **Caching & Precomputation:** Cache results from `code_parser.py` and dependency analysis tools to avoid redundant computation.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Enhance agents to gracefully handle parsing failures, compile errors, and missing data, with clear recovery strategies.
* **File Tree Inspection:** Use a `tree` tool to capture an exact directory structure before transformations, guiding extraction and refactoring agents.
