Phased Extraction Plan for Migrating the Least-Coupled Module (util.Resources) to Java 21 and Spring Boot

1. Identification of the Least-Coupled Module
--------------------------------------------
- The module `org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.util` containing the class `Resources` is identified as the least coupled module.
- It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies on or from other modules, making it ideal for an initial phased extraction.
- This isolation simplifies migration and integration processes while minimizing risks to the overall system.

2. Migration Goals and Scope
----------------------------
- Migrate the `Resources` utility class from legacy Jakarta EE/JBoss EAP environment to a new Spring Boot module with Java 21 support.
- Replace legacy logging mechanisms with Spring Boot recommended SLF4J logging backed by Logback.
- Refactor code to utilize Spring's Dependency Injection and component scanning.
- Allow coexistence with legacy applications during incremental migration phases.
- Provide a reusable utility module for other modules during and after migration.

3. Dependency Minimization Strategies
-------------------------------------
- Since the util module is isolated, no immediate dependencies to break or refactor.
- Ensure that the migrated module exposes interfaces or Spring Beans consumable by legacy modules via CDI or Spring’s support for Java Interoperability.
- Avoid tight coupling by defining well-scoped service APIs if needed.
- Use Spring's conditional configurations to support coexistence.
- Limit legacy and new code dependencies to module boundaries.

4. Comprehensive List of Components to Migrate in Order
-------------------------------------------------------
- Step 1: Migrate the single file:
    - `kitchensink/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/kitchensink/util/Resources.java`
- Within `Resources.java`:
    - Refactor all logging or utility methods to use SLF4J interfaces.
    - Convert class into Spring Bean via `@Component` annotation or configure as explicit bean.
- No other classes in util present for migration at this phase.

5. Detailed Phased Extraction Plan with Steps and Deliverables
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Phase 1: Preparation and Setup
- Create a new Maven or Gradle module/project for the util package, targeting Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.x.
- Include Spring Boot starter dependencies (spring-boot-starter, spring-boot-starter-logging).
- Establish project directory structure following Spring Boot conventions.
- Deliverable: New standalone Spring Boot module repository with baseline dependencies and build configuration.

### Phase 2: Code Migration and Refactoring
- Copy the original `Resources.java` file into the new module, maintaining the package structure.
- Refactor imports from legacy Jakarta to Spring and SLF4J:
    - Replace any `java.util.logging` or JBoss Logging usage with SLF4J.
    - Replace legacy annotations (if any) with Spring stereotypes.
- Annotate `Resources` with `@Component` to enable Spring's dependency injection.
- Adapt any constructor or method signatures as needed for Spring context.
- Deliverable: Fully refactored `Resources.java` class compiled and unit tested in the new module.

### Phase 3: Integration with Legacy Code (Coexistence Strategy)
- Expose the util module as a Maven artifact or module dependency consumable by the legacy application.
- In the legacy application, inject or lookup the new `Resources` bean via either:
    - CDI-Spring bridge mechanisms or,
    - Service locator pattern temporarily until full migration.
- Support fallback to legacy util standalone usage as needed.
- Provide integration tests validating both legacy and new usage scenarios.
- Deliverable: Bridging mechanism enabling legacy and new modules to coexist with shared util functionality.

### Phase 4: Incremental Rollout and Validation
- Implement CI/CD pipelines to build, test, and deploy the new util module independently.
- Coordinate with other teams to incrementally replace legacy util references with new Spring Boot module references.
- Monitor runtime logs, behavior to ensure consistency.
- Deliverable: Automated pipelines and migration checkpoints showing successful integration.

6. Paragraph with List of Actions the Agentic AI Shall Perform
--------------------------------------------------------------

The agentic AI will perform the following actions sequentially:

1. Extract the file `Resources.java` from the legacy codebase at path `kitchensink/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/kitchensink/util/Resources.java`.
2. Analyze and refactor the logging mechanism in `Resources.java` to replace legacy logging with SLF4J interfaces.
3. Annotate `Resources` class with `@Component` for Spring dependency injection compatibility.
4. Adjust package imports and any deprecated Jakarta EE namespaces to their Spring Boot equivalents.
5. Create a new isolated Spring Boot module targeting Java 21, and place the refactored `Resources` class within it.
6. Configure the new module with Spring Boot starter dependencies, including logging.
7. Compile and unit test the migrated `Resources` class inside the new module to verify functionality.
8. Package the Spring Boot util module into a Maven artifact ready for consumption.
9. Develop integration configurations or adapters enabling the legacy code to consume the new module via dependency injection or service locators.
10. Coordinate iterative deployment and testing cycles, enabling coexistence and verifying no regressions.

7. Coexistence Strategy: Legacy and Updated Module Integration
--------------------------------------------------------------

- During migration, the legacy application continues to use its original util code, while the new Spring Boot util module runs side-by-side.
- Integration via Dependency Injection Bridges:
    - Use CDI-Spring ecosystem bridging libraries if possible to inject Spring beans into legacy Jakarta EE components.
    - Alternatively, legacy code can instantiate or lookup Spring Bean contexts programmatically.
- Introduce Facade or Adapter Patterns:
    - Create facades/interfaces in the legacy module abstracting util services.
    - Delegate these services dynamically to the Spring Boot util module via injected beans.
- Conditional Bean Loading:
    - Employ Spring Profiles or conditional annotations to enable or disable the new util module usage during rollout.
- Logging Harmonization:
    - Ensure consistent logging configuration across the legacy server and new Spring Boot context by harmonizing logging frameworks.
- Gradually refactor legacy clients to directly consume the Spring Boot module until all legacy references are removed.
- Validate correctness with cross-module integration testing and monitoring.

Summary
-------

By targeting the least coupled `util` module first—especially the `Resources` class—this plan lays a low-risk foundation for the modernization of the Kitchensink project. The phased extraction and migration approach ensures controlled incremental progress with clear deliverables and fallback support for coexistence. Dependency minimization through isolated modularization ensures minimal friction, enabling the agentic AI to execute migration tasks efficiently and reliably.

This strategic approach can then be leveraged as a model for subsequent module migrations of increasing coupling complexity in the Kitchensink codebase.
